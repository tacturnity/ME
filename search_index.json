    "textContent": "this chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of engineering materials, focusing on their classification, structure, and particularly their mechanical properties. understanding these properties is crucial for selecting appropriate materials for manufacturing specific products and for predicting their behavior during processing and in service. the chapter also covers common engineering materials and the factors involved in material selection, along with solved examples illustrating the calculation of mechanical properties. 2.1 introduction core idea: materials are fundamental to all technology. choosing the right material with the right properties is crucial for any product, from a microchip to a bridge. different parts of a product often require different materials because they have different functions. example (car): steel for the body (strong, formable), plastics for dashboards/seats (lightweight, mouldable, colours), glass for windows (transparent, hard), reinforced plastics for bumpers. materials science involves understanding and manipulating materials to achieve desired properties. major classes of materials: metals: iron, copper, aluminium, gold, etc. (strong, ductile, conductive). ceramics: sand, bricks, glass, graphite (hard, brittle, insulators, high-temperature resistance). polymers (plastics): nylon, teflon, polyethylene (lightweight, easily shaped, insulators, lower strength). composites: mixtures of materials (e.g., carbon fibres in epoxy). designed to combine properties. semiconductors: silicon, germanium (electrical properties between conductors and insulators). key link: a material's structure (how its atoms or molecules are arranged) determines its properties (mechanical, electrical, etc.). crucially, processing (how we treat the material) affects its structure and therefore its properties. example (steel): if steel is cooled slowly from high temperature, it's relatively soft. if the same steel is cooled rapidly (quenched), it becomes very hard and brittle. this is due to changes in its internal crystal structure caused by the cooling rate. 2.2 structure of materials understanding material structure is key to understanding its properties and behavior. this section focuses mainly on metals. 2.2.1 crystalline structure when metals solidify, their atoms arrange in a regular, repeating 3d pattern called a crystal. space lattice: the geometric pattern of atom positions. unit cell: the smallest repeating unit of the space lattice (like a single brick in a wall). common metal crystal structures (fig 2.1): face-centred cubic (fcc): atoms at corners and center of each face of a cube. (e.g., copper, gold, aluminium, nickel). key property: generally good ductility (ability to deform without breaking). body-centred cubic (bcc): atoms at corners and one atom in the very center of the cube. (e.g., iron (at room temp), chromium, molybdenum). key property: generally strong, moderate ductility. hexagonal close-packed (hcp): atoms in a hexagonal pattern. (e.g., zinc, titanium, magnesium, cobalt). key property: ductility varies, can be strong. polymorphic: a material that can exist in more than one crystal lattice type, often changing with temperature. x-ray diffraction: a technique used to determine crystal structure and atom positions. non-crystalline (amorphous): some materials (like glass, some plastics, metallic glasses) solidify without forming a regular crystal structure. their atoms are arranged randomly. 2.3 properties of materials materials have various properties: physical: density, melting point, colour. chemical: reactivity, corrosion resistance. electrical: conductivity, resistivity. impurities reduce metal conductivity but can increase semiconductor conductivity (e.g., phosphorus in silicon). mechanical: how a material responds to applied forces. this is the main focus for manufacturing. example: cast iron is brittle (a mechanical property), so it can't be easily shaped by forming processes that require significant deformation. 2.4 mechanical properties these describe how materials deform or resist forces. they are measured in standardized tests so different materials can be compared. mechanical properties are defined to be independent of specimen size/geometry for comparison. 2.4.1 types of stresses (see figure 2.2 for visual representation) tensile load (fig. 2.2a): equal and opposite forces pulling a body, causing elongation. the internal resisting stress is tensile stress. compressive load (fig. 2.2b): equal and opposite forces pushing into a body, causing shortening. the internal resisting stress is compressive stress. shear load (fig. 2.2c): opposite forces acting radially across a section. the internal resisting stress is shear stress (or transverse stress). stress (s or σ): internal resistance force per unit area. measured in n/m² (pascals, pa) or mpa. $$ \\color{white} \\text{stress} (s) = \\frac{f}{a_0} \\quad (\\text{eq } 2.1) $$ strain (e or ε): measure of deformation relative to original size. it's dimensionless (m/m or often expressed as %). $$ \\color{white} \\text{strain} (e) = \\frac{\\delta l}{l_0} \\quad (\\text{eq } 2.2) $$ axial vs. lateral strain (fig 2.3): when you pull (tensile stress) a bar, it gets longer (axial strain) but also thinner (lateral strain). poisson's ratio relates these. under compression, it contracts axially and expands transversely (fig. 2.7b). linear strain (axial strain): strain in the direction of applied load. lateral strain (perpendicular strain): strain at right angles to the applied load. 2.4.2 stress-strain relationship a fundamental test (tensile test, fig 2.4) pulls a standard specimen and measures load and elongation. plotting stress vs. strain gives the stress-strain curve (fig. 2.5). (fig 2.5a - ductile material like brass/aluminium; fig 2.5b - ductile material like mild steel) elastic region (origin to p/q): material deforms but returns to original shape when load is removed. stress is proportional to strain in the initial linear part (origin to p). proportional limit (p): end of the straight-line portion. elastic limit (q): maximum stress before permanent deformation occurs. often very close to p. young's modulus (e) / modulus of elasticity: slope of the linear elastic region. it measures the material's stiffness or resistance to elastic deformation. a higher e means stiffer material. $$ \\color{white} e = \\frac{\\text{stress}}{\\text{strain}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon} \\quad (\\text{eq } 2.3) $$ $$ \\color{white} e = \\frac{(f/a_0)}{(\\delta l/l_0)} = \\frac{f l_0}{a_0 \\delta l} \\quad (\\text{eq } 2.4) $$ elongation can be calculated as: $$ \\color{white} \\delta l = \\frac{f l_0}{a_0 e} \\quad (\\text{eq } 2.5) $$ plastic region (right of q): material undergoes permanent deformation. it will not return to its original shape after load removal. yield point / yield strength (y): the stress at which significant plastic deformation starts. mild steel (fig 2.5b) shows a clear yield point. for others (fig 2.5a), it's often defined by the 0.2% offset method (draw line parallel to elastic slope from 0.2% strain; where it hits the curve is the yield strength). this is a critical value for design, marking the onset of permanent damage. ultimate tensile strength (uts) (t): the maximum stress the material can withstand on the curve. corresponds to the maximum load. necking: after uts, ductile materials often start to locally thin down ('neck') before breaking (visible in fig 2.4). fracture / breaking strength (r): the stress at which the material breaks. brittle materials (fig 2.6): show very little or no plastic deformation. they fracture soon after the uts, often without yielding. (e.g., cast iron, glass). 2.4.3 toughness ability to absorb energy (especially under sudden impact) before fracturing. includes both strength and ductility. represented by the total area under the stress-strain curve up to fracture. important for parts subject to impact loads (gears, tools, milling cutters). 2.4.4 hardness resistance to scratching, indentation, or wear. general indication of strength. diamond is the hardest. important for tools, surfaces that rub against each other, and machine tool structures. hard materials are often difficult to machine. 2.4.5 ductility ability to undergo significant plastic deformation under tensile stress before fracture. indicates ability to be drawn into wires. (e.g., gold (28.35g can be drawn into 80 km of thin wire)). essential for forming processes like deep drawing and bending (e.g., automobile body). (quantified by % elongation or % reduction in area at fracture). materials with little or no ductility are brittle. 2.4.6 brittleness lack of ductility. material undergoes very little plastic deformation before rupture. exhibits no yielding or necking. ruptures suddenly at ultimate strength. weak and unreliable in tension. brittle materials often fail suddenly. can happen at stresses below yield strength, especially under impact, low temperatures, or if flaws are present. dangerous as it's often catastrophic and without warning. examples: cast iron, glass, ceramics. 2.4.7 malleability ability to undergo significant plastic deformation under compressive stress without fracture. allows hammering/rolling into thin sheets. different from ductility (tensile quality). malleability is a compressive quality. (note: lead is malleable but not very ductile. silver is both). examples: aluminum, lead, copper, tin. 2.4.8 resilience ability to absorb energy elastically (i.e., without permanent deformation) and release it upon unloading. measured by the area under the elastic portion of the stress-strain curve (fig. 2.5). important for shock absorbers, springs. 2.4.9 stiffness ability of a material to resist deformation (elastic). measured by young's modulus (e). high e = high stiffness. example: steel (e ≈ 210 gpa) is three times stiffer than aluminum (e ≈ 70 gpa). for the same stress and cross-section, aluminum deforms three times more than steel. 2.4.10 poisson's ratio (ν) (see figure 2.7 for visual representation) the ratio of lateral (transverse) strain (εt) to axial strain (εa) during elastic deformation. it's a material constant within the proportionality limit. $$ \\color{white} \\nu = - \\frac{\\text{lateral strain}}{\\text{axial strain}} = - \\frac{\\varepsilon_t}{\\varepsilon_a} \\quad (\\text{eq } 2.6) $$ it's negative because if length increases (positive axial strain), width decreases (negative lateral strain), and vice versa. for most metals, ν is around 0.3. 2.5 modes of fracture how materials break. understanding how and why materials fail is important. determined by crystal structure, purity, properties, temperature, stress state, loading rate, environment. four general classes of fracture mechanisms: ductile fracture (2.5.1 & fig 2.8): occurs after significant plastic deformation, typically above the yield point. characteristic features: necking, formation and growth of internal voids, final shear failure (often at 45°). requires considerable energy for plastic deformation in the necking region. preferred mode in many situations as it gives warning. important in metalworking (deep drawing, forging). brittle fracture (2.5.2): occurs suddenly with little/no plastic deformation. cracks spread rapidly. brittle metals are weak as they offer little resistance to crack propagation. ductile metals deform rather than allowing cracks to propagate. can happen at stresses below yield strength, especially under impact/shock loads, low temperatures, or if flaws are present. dangerous as it's often catastrophic and without warning. more likely in large components or under shock loading. creep fracture (2.5.3): time-dependent failure under constant stress, especially at high temperatures (even below the normal yield strength). material slowly stretches over time until it breaks. creep: plastic/inelastic distortion under long-term loading. amount depends on elasticity, yield strength, stress, temperature. critical for components like jet engine turbine blades, boiler tubes (e.g., turbine blades at 1200°c). fatigue fracture (2.5.4): failure due to cyclic or repeated loading (stress going up and down). fracture can occur at stresses well below the uts or even the yield strength. occurs suddenly and unexpectedly. described as \"progressive fracture.\" starts as a small crack (often at a surface defect or stress concentration) which grows progressively with each cycle until the remaining area can no longer support the load. very common failure mode in machinery (axles, springs, wings). example: bending a paperclip back and forth breaks it due to fatigue. 2.6 factor of safety (fos) concept: designs are based on an allowable stress that is lower than the material's actual failure stress (yield strength for ductile, uts for brittle). the ratio is the factor of safety. $$ \\color{white} \\text{fos} = \\frac{\\text{yield stress}}{\\text{design stress}} \\quad (\\text{eq } 2.7) \\quad \\text{(for ductile materials)} $$ $$ \\color{white} \\text{fos} = \\frac{\\text{ultimate stress}}{\\text{design stress}} \\quad (\\text{eq } 2.8) \\quad \\text{(for brittle materials)} $$ why use fos? to account for uncertainties: variations in material properties (never perfectly uniform). uncertainty in load calculations or unexpected loads. manufacturing defects (small cracks, imperfections). environmental effects (corrosion, temperature). method of analysis limitations. value: depends on the application. higher fos is used for critical components (e.g., aircraft parts, pressure vessels) where failure risk is unacceptable, or under fatigue/uncertain conditions. lower fos might be used where weight or cost is paramount and conditions are well understood. factors considered when choosing fos: variation/non-homogeneity in material properties. uncertainty in analysis methods and manufacturing inaccuracies (e.g., surface finish, blowholes). environmental conditions. type of application. 2.7 common engineering materials brief overview of commonly used metals and alloys (metals mixed with other elements). metals are seldom used in pure state; usually as alloys. cast iron (2.7.1): ferrous alloy: iron + high carbon (2.1-4.5%) & silicon (~3.5%). hard, brittle. free graphite gives self-lubricating properties. excellent vibration damping. good compressive strength, weak in tension. used for machine beds, frames. types: gray (good wear resistance, e.g., machine tool guideways), malleable (improved toughness, e.g., agricultural/textile machinery parts), sg/ductile iron (strength/toughness near steel, e.g., crankshafts, connecting rods). steel (2.7.2): most common engineering material. iron alloy with < 2.1% carbon, often other elements (mn, si, cr, cu). highly versatile, properties adjustable via alloying & heat treatment. classification by carbon content (see table 2.1 for applications): low carbon (mild) steel (0.05-0.3% c): ductile, weldable, relatively cheap. uses: structural shapes, car bodies, sheet metal, wire. medium carbon steel (0.3-0.7% c): stronger, harder than mild steel. uses: agricultural implements, axles, gears, shafts, hammers, springs, dies. high carbon steel (0.7-1.5% c): hardest, strongest, wear-resistant, less ductile. uses: cutting blades, chisels, woodworking tools, metal cutting tools, razor blades, files, drills. aluminium (al) (2.7.3): non-ferrous. lightweight (~1/3 of steel), excellent thermal/electrical conductor, good corrosion resistance. very good ductility. easy to mould, workable hot or cold. uses: packaging, consumer durables, utensils, electrical appliances, aircraft parts, airplanes/jet engines (75-85% of components). copper (cu) (2.7.4): non-ferrous. excellent heat/electricity conductor, corrosion-resistant. soft, tough, easy to mould, workable hot or cold. pure form: thermal/electrical uses (e.g., electrical wiring, plumbing pipes, heat exchangers). alloys: brass (cu+zn): utensils, household fittings, decorative objects. can be machined at high speeds for fine surface finish. bronze (cu+sn): good corrosion resistance. used for valves, bearings. can be machined at high speeds for fine surface finish. lead (pb) (2.7.5): durable, versatile. high density, easy workability. good corrosion resistance (many acids don't affect it). uses: batteries, radiation shielding, solder (lead-tin alloy). zinc (zn) (2.7.6): low melting point. fourth most used metal (after fe, al, cu). used for galvanizing (coating steel for corrosion resistance), die casting alloys. uses (zinc alloys): carburetors, fuel pumps, automobile parts, fittings. tin (sn) (2.7.7): soft, ductile, very good malleability. resists corrosion in wet/dry conditions; used as protective coating for iron/steel (tin cans for food). uses: coating steel (tin cans), solder, bearings (tin-base white metals for high pressure/load). 2.8 selection of material choosing the right material is a critical engineering decision, often involving trade-offs. material cost can be ~50% of total manufacturing cost. it is a crucial decision considering physical and mechanical properties, which can dictate the manufacturing process and affect final cost. steps: define requirements: what function must the part perform? what properties are needed (strength, hardness, weight limit, corrosion resistance, cost target, appearance)? based on overall objectives (cost, durability, life, function). example (coins): need good ductility, hardness, corrosion resistance, high plasticity, lightweight. find possible materials: list materials that meet the key requirements. (e.g., for coins: gold, silver, copper, alloys). make a choice: evaluate the candidates based on all factors, including cost, availability, ease of manufacturing (processability), reliability, aesthetics. consider influencing factors/restrictions (availability, cost, aesthetics). example (coins): gold, silver, copper alloys work. final choice depends heavily on cost and availability. example (razor blades): need malleability (to make thin), high hardness (for sharp edge), corrosion resistance, low cost, abrasive resistance. stainless steel is common, often with special edge treatments/alloys for hardness. (skipping 2.9 solved examples and review questions as requested.) this chapter provides the foundation for understanding why certain materials are chosen for specific applications and how their inherent properties influence which manufacturing processes can be used effectively. remember the key definitions (stress, strain, e, yield strength, uts, ductility, hardness, toughness, fatigue, creep) and the different types of materials.",

    "textContent": "this chapter discusses the importance of measurement in manufacturing to ensure parts meet specified dimensions and quality standards. it covers fundamental metrology concepts, types of inspection, key terminologies like accuracy, precision, tolerance, surface finish, quality, reliability, and interchangeability. it also introduces measuring instruments, the system of limits and fits, and quality aspects like quality control, zero quality control, and iso 9000. 3.1 introduction measurement has been vital since societies began, for trade and defining boundaries. early units (palm, inch, foot, yard) were non-standard and varied. modern measurements can be accurate to $10^{-12}$ mm or less. accurate measurement and inspection are essential in manufacturing to ensure: components are made to requirements, consistently and within specified dimensional accuracy. parts fit and assemble correctly to perform their intended function. quality control is crucial for producing better products and satisfying customers. dimensional accuracy is a key aspect of product quality. 3.2 metrology metrology: the science of measurement. in manufacturing, this often involves measuring linear or angular dimensions. 1. what is measurement? the act of determining measurable properties of an object (e.g., diameter, length, hardness, weight, voltage). 2. what is inspection? examination of a part to determine if it meets designer specifications (correct size, shape, weight, etc.). 3. how is measurement different from inspection? inspection involves measurements to determine if specifications are met. inspection can also be done without direct measurement, for example, by gauging: determining if a dimension is within specified maximum and minimum limits. testing: a related term; the process to know the performance of a product (e.g., testing material strength, or if a finished product performs to design specs). 3.3 inspection inspection can be: post-process inspection: done after the part is produced. on-line inspection (in-process or real-time inspection): done while the part is being produced on the machine. necessary because dimensional variations occur due to material property changes, thermal effects, tool wear. advantage: reduces wastage compared to post-process inspection. automated inspection: can be used for both on-line and post-process; more suitable for on-line. 3.4 definition of terms 3.4.1 accuracy accuracy of measurement: capability of an instrument to give an accurate measure. example: measuring 15 mm with a scale vs. 15.31 mm with a micrometer. the micrometer is more accurate. modern industry requires micron-level accuracy (0.000001 m). accuracy of manufacturing: how closely a manufactured part's measurement matches the true or specified value. example: specified dimension = 15.25 mm. part 1 measures 15.52 mm, part 2 measures 15.38 mm. part 2 is more accurately manufactured. 3.4.2 precision how close together multiple readings of the same measurement are, using the same instrument. example: five readings of 15.15, 15.48, 15.37, 15.52, 15.23 mm show low precision (values are spread out). readings of 15.30, 15.31, 15.29, 15.30, 15.31 mm show high precision (values are close together). note: an instrument can be precise but not accurate (e.g., consistently gives readings that are close together but far from the true value). 3.4.3 tolerance (figure 3.1) it's practically impossible to make parts to exact dimensions. basic size: the desired theoretical size specified by the designer. tolerance: the permissible deviation of a dimension from the basic size. it defines the acceptable range (largest acceptable dimension to smallest acceptable dimension). determined by the function of the part. closer tolerances increase manufacturing cost. 3.4.4 surface finish (surface texture) the amount of geometric irregularity on an object's surface from fabrication. important for proper functioning of mating surfaces (e.g., pistons, gears) to reduce friction and wear. an absolutely smooth surface is impossible; all surfaces have irregularities. also important for aesthetics. 3.4.5 quality assessing a product's performance. a characteristic property considering surface finish, functionality, accuracy, performance, aesthetics, etc. definitions: \"fitness for purpose,\" \"measure of fulfilment of promises by manufacturers.\" relative term, depends on end use. depends on material, manufacturing method, tools, operator skill, etc. 3.4.6 reliability measure of a product functioning as intended, over its intended life, under normal operating conditions. associated with the quality of performance over time. example: a watch should show the correct time, not just run. a watch that runs but is always wrong is not reliable. requirement varies by product: very high for airplanes, can be less for a pen. 3.4.7 interchangeability concept where any part from a lot a (all made within tolerance) will assemble correctly with any part from lot b (also made within tolerance). overcomes tedious and expensive custom fitting of parts. achieved by establishing permissible inaccuracy (tolerance). permits parts to be made in large batches; simplifies assembly and repair (e.g., replacing a worn ball bearing or a fused electric bulb with a new one of the same specification). integral to standardization and mass production. 3.5 measuring and inspection instruments classified into three categories: 3.5.1 direct-measuring instruments the dimension is directly compared to a standard calibrated instrument, which gives the value. obtains value without assistance from other instruments. examples: scale (for length), vernier caliper, micrometer (for linear dimensions), sine bar, protractors (for angles), optical flats (for flatness), dial indicator (for ovality). 3.5.2 indirect-measuring instruments require another measuring instrument to get the measurement. transfers the measurement from workpiece to a direct-measuring instrument (comparison measuring). examples: simple calipers, comparators (mechanical, electronic, pneumatic). comparators indicate deviation from a specified size. 3.5.3 gauges (figure 3.2, figure 3.3) used to determine dimensional acceptability (whether a dimension is within specified tolerance), not the exact dimension. faster, easier, lower inspection cost than direct measurement, especially for large quantities. not general-purpose; each gauge is for a specific dimension of a specific part. \"go-nogo\" gauge (fig. 3.2a): has two ends/openings. go end (fig. 3.2b): corresponds to the maximum acceptable size of a feature (e.g., minimum hole size or maximum shaft size, depending on whether it's an internal or external feature. for a hole, go corresponds to minimum hole size; for a shaft, go corresponds to maximum shaft size. figure 3.2 shows a snap gauge for an external feature, where go is the maximum acceptable size of the part). the description in the text for figure 3.2b has \"go size corresponding to the maximum acceptable size\" which seems to refer to an external feature like a shaft. if it were for a hole, go would be the minimum acceptable hole size. nogo end (fig. 3.2b): corresponds to the minimum acceptable size of a feature (e.g., maximum hole size or minimum shaft size. for the external feature in figure 3.2, nogo corresponds to the minimum acceptable size of the part). usage (fig. 3.3 - checking an external dimension): good part (fig. 3.3a): passes through go end, does not pass through nogo end. oversized part (fig. 3.3b): does not pass through go end. (rejected). undersized part (fig. 3.3c): passes through go end and nogo end. (rejected). example: basic size 10 mm, tolerance ±0.1 mm. acceptable range: 9.9 mm to 10.1 mm. for an external feature (shaft): go gauge = 10.1 mm, nogo gauge = 9.9 mm. part 10.2 mm (oversized): won't pass go. rejected. part 9.7 mm (undersized): passes go and nogo. rejected. part 10.05 mm (good): passes go, doesn't pass nogo. accepted. 3.5.4 inspection in mass production inspecting every item is often uneconomical/unnecessary (e.g., nuts, bolts). sampling: a small percentage of components is randomly picked from a lot for inspection. if the percentage of bad components in the sample exceeds a limit, the whole lot is rejected. not suitable for vital components (e.g., engine piston) where 100% inspection might be needed. 3.6 limits and fits early manufacturing involved custom fitting, which was slow and costly. manufacturing parts within permissible deviation (tolerance) allows for proper assembly without additional machining. system of limits and fits: a standardized system for interchangeable part manufacture and proper assembly. reduces cost, allows easy part replacement. the iso system of limits and fits is widely used. benefits: interchangeability and ease of assembly. eliminates minor rectifications (fitting) during assembly. avoids unnecessary high accuracy/surface finish, saving cost. 3.7 tolerance (revisited in context of limits and fits - figure 3.4) acceptance of manufacturing error; a dimension cannot be economically made to an exact size. tolerance: difference between the maximum and minimum limit of size of a part (total permissible variation). nominal size (basic size, dn): theoretical size specified by design, usually a rounded whole-millimeter value. represented by the zero line (0-0). deviations: specified from the zero line. upper deviation: difference between maximum limit of size (dmax) and nominal size. lower deviation: difference between minimum limit of size (dmin) and nominal size. deviations can be on one or both sides of the zero line (fig. 3.4a - both sides, fig. 3.4b - one side, minus direction). limits of size (dmax, dmin): minimum and maximum allowed dimensions. acceptable parts are within these limits. tolerance = dmax - dmin. selection of tolerance depends on: nominal size. manufacturing method used. accuracy and quality desired. type of fit required. types of tolerances (figure 3.5): unilateral tolerance (fig. 3.5a): applies in one direction from nominal size; other direction's variation is zero. example: 24.000 (+0.030 / -0) mm. max size = 24.030, min size = 24.000. bilateral tolerance (fig. 3.5b): split (equally or unequally) and applied on both sides of nominal size. example: 24.000 (+0.025 / -0.005) mm. max size = 24.025, min size = 23.995. 3.8 fits (figure 3.6, 3.7, 3.8) fit: general term for the relative degree of tightness or looseness of assembled mating parts (e.g., shaft and hole), which determines relative movement. allowance: the intentional difference between the hole size and shaft size (before tolerances are applied to each). three types of fits: 3.8.1 clearance fit (figure 3.6) assembled parts are always free to move relative to each other. size of the hole is always larger than the size of the shaft. clearance: difference between hole size and shaft size. results in a positive allowance (air space). parts can be assembled by hand. examples: door hinges, shaft and bearing, wheel and axle. maximum clearance: max hole size - min shaft size. minimum clearance: min hole size - max shaft size. (both must be > 0 for a clearance fit). 3.8.2 interference fit (figure 3.7) mating parts are joined tightly; no relative motion possible. size of the hole is always smaller than the size of the shaft. interference (negative clearance/allowance): difference between shaft size and hole size. used for permanent/semi-permanent assembly needing rigidity (e.g., dowel pins, bearings in casting). parts usually pressed together (e.g., using an arbor press). maximum interference: max shaft size - min hole size. minimum interference: min shaft size - max hole size. (both must be > 0 for an interference fit). 3.8.3 transition fit (figure 3.8) limits of size for hole and shaft overlap, so either a clearance or an interference may result. compromise fit; small amount of clearance or interference is permissible. sometimes shaft is larger than hole, sometimes smaller. 3.9 quality aspects 3.9.1 quality control systematic control of factors affecting product quality. involves inspection, testing, analysis to ensure product meets standards. emphasis on quality of future production (e.g., worker education). often handled by a separate quality control department. quality control involves inspection, but inspection alone isn't quality control. 3.9.2 zero quality control concept (developed by japanese): \"do the things right at the first time.\" if every job is done right always, no need for qc/inspection. argues inspection implies distrust of workers. automation reduces human error. assures quality at the source; system should be immune to errors and self-correcting. poka yoke: japanese term for \"error-proofing\" systems (e.g., word processor spell/grammar check). a defective product should not move to the next process. 3.9.3 iso 9000 iso: international organisation for standardization (geneva), founded 1947. develops standards to facilitate global trade. india represented by bureau of indian standards. iso 9000 series: internationally recognized quality management standards. generic, applicable to any organization. ensures consistent production and timely delivery. helps meet customer expectations, keeping them satisfied/loyal. certification distinguishes an organization, controls quality, saves money. reasons for adopting iso 9000: improve quality, reduce costs, be competitive, customer expectation, mandatory requirement. implementation: starts with gap analysis (identify differences between current processes and iso 9000 standard), then steps to fill gaps, improving overall performance. 3.10 solved examples example 3.1 hole: 29.00 (+0.013/+0) mm, shaft: 29.00 (+0/-0.013) mm. max hole = 29.00 + 0.013 = 29.013 mm min hole = 29.00 + 0 = 29.000 mm max shaft = 29.00 + 0 = 29.000 mm min shaft = 29.00 - 0.013 = 28.987 mm max clearance: max hole - min shaft = 29.013 - 28.987 = 0.026 mm min clearance: min hole - max shaft = 29.000 - 29.000 = 0.000 mm since both clearances $\\ge$ 0, it's a clearance fit. example 3.2 hole: 50.00 (-0.026/-0.065) mm, shaft: 50.00 (-0/-0.011) mm. max hole = 50.00 - 0.026 = 49.974 mm min hole = 50.00 - 0.065 = 49.935 mm max shaft = 50.00 - 0 = 50.000 mm min shaft = 50.00 - 0.011 = 49.989 mm max clearance (smallest hole - largest shaft for potential tightest condition): max hole - min shaft = 49.974 - 49.989 = -0.015 mm min clearance (largest hole - smallest shaft for potential loosest condition): min hole - max shaft = 49.935 - 50.000 = -0.065 mm the text calculates based on \"max clearance = max hole - min shaft\" and \"min clearance = min hole - max shaft\". this convention is for clearance. if we are calculating \"interference\" the terms would be swapped for shaft and hole. since both calculated \"clearances\" are negative, this means there is always interference. max possible interference is 0.065mm, min possible interference is 0.015mm. it's an interference fit. example 3.3 three blocks a, b, c in a channel d. min gap e $\\ge$ 0.005 mm. a = 0.75 ± 0.003 mm => max a = 0.753 mm b = 1.0 ± 0.005 mm => max b = 1.005 mm c = 1.125 ± 0.004 mm => max c = 1.129 mm basic d = 2.894 mm. condition for minimum gap e: min d = max a + max b + max c + min e min d = 0.753 + 1.005 + 1.129 + 0.005 = 2.892 mm let min d = basic d - x (where x is the lower deviation for d, assuming unilateral tolerance for d with upper deviation 0, i.e., d (+0 / -x) ) 2.892 = 2.894 - x x = 2.894 - 2.892 = 0.002 mm so, dimension of channel d = 2.894 (+0 / -0.002) mm. (the pdf text shows (0.750+0.003)+(1+0.005)+(1.125+0.004)+(0.005) = (2.894-x). this matches: max a = 0.753, max b = 1.005, max c = 1.129. sum = 2.887. 2.887 + 0.005 = 2.892. so 2.892 = 2.894 - x, x = 0.002 mm).",

    "textContent": "this chapter explains the fundamentals of metal cutting (machining). it starts by defining machining and machine tools, then delves into the mechanism of metal cutting, essential properties and types of cutting tool materials, classification of cutting tools, the geometry of single-point cutting tools including various angles, types of chips produced, thermal aspects of machining, tool failure modes, the role of cutting fluids, operating conditions (speed, feed, depth of cut), and the concept of tool life including taylor's equation. 4.1 introduction (figure 4.1) machining (metal cutting): the process of removing unwanted material (chip or scrap) from a workpiece (stock) using a machine and a cutting tool to achieve a desired shape and size. (fig. 4.1): shows a raw cylindrical bar (a), the desired stepped diameter finished product (b), and the metal to be cut (c). cutting tool: the device used to cut the material. machine tools: power-driven machines that shape metals (or other materials) to produce components by operations like cutting. machining is often necessary/preferred for: achieving closer dimensional accuracy than other processes (casting, forming). finishing heat-treated parts that may have distorted. producing special surface characteristics (e.g., high reflectivity with diamond tools). economical production, especially in small quantities. when shape/size is unsuitable for other methods. metal cutting constitutes about 35% of all manufacturing processes. machining should be avoided if possible as it produces waste, consumes more energy/capital/labor, and can take longer than forming/shaping. on average, about half the material is removed as chips. 4.2 machine tools machines on which metal cutting or forming processes are carried out. functions: holding workpiece, holding tool, providing relative motion between tool and workpiece, supplying energy for cutting. machine vs. machine tool: a machine converts input to output (e.g., refrigerator). machine tools are a specific type of machine that imparts shape by removing material as chips. broad classification: metal cutting machine tools. metal forming machine tools. classification of metal cutting machine tools (examples): degree of specialization: general-purpose (lathe, shaper, milling machine). special-purpose (gear-cutting/hobbing machine). type of surface produced: cylindrical surface (lathe, drilling machine). flat surface (milling machine, shaper). type of motion: reciprocatory (shaper, planer, slotter). rotary (lathe, drilling machine, grinding machine). degree of automation: manual, semi-automatic, automatic. duty cycle: light, medium, heavy duty. type of energy used: conventional (mechanical energy: lathe, drilling). non-conventional (chemical, electro-discharge energy). 4.3 cutting tools device used to remove unwanted material. essential for machining. 4.3.1 mechanism of metal cutting (figure 4.2) similar to sharpening a pencil or peeling an apple. tool penetrates workpiece and moves forward, chipping off a layer. (fig. 4.2): workpiece clamped, wedge-shaped tool set to a depth of cut, forced to move. sharp edge forced into metal. stress increases beyond elastic limit, then ultimate strength. shear failure occurs, separating a layer as a chip (fig. 4.2b). continued relative motion removes a layer as a chip (fig. 4.2c). essential properties of a cutting tool: harder than work material (to penetrate). strong enough to withstand cutting forces (not bend/deform). hard and tough. heat resistant (high hot hardness) to maintain hardness at high temperatures ($>600^\\circ c$ for hss). wear resistant to prevent fast wear of cutting edge. (tool & workpiece experience high pressure, friction, heating, leading to wear). 4.4 tool materials performance depends on wear resistance, hot hardness, toughness (gain in one often means loss in other). development of new tool materials often drives machine tool design changes. materials include: tool steels, high-speed steels (hss), carbides, ucon, ceramics, synthetic diamond, cubic boron nitride (cbn). 4.4.1 tool steel (ts) (carbon tool steel) carbon content 0.8-1.5%. easily hardened. for cutting ferrous/non-ferrous metals. disadvantages: low hot hardness (loses hardness at 200-250°c), poor wear resistance. used for low cutting speeds. effect of alloying elements (table 4.1): mn: improves machinability (free cutting steels). ni: improves strength, toughness, corrosion resistance. cr: improves strength, toughness, corrosion resistance. p: causes brittleness, improves machinability. s: reduces hot hardness, improves machinability. si: makes steel tough and harder. 4.4.2 high-speed steel (hss) alloy steel (tungsten, chromium, molybdenum etc.). retains hardness up to 600°c. superior hot hardness and wear resistance. cutting speeds 2-3 times > carbon steels. types (based on alloying %): 18-4-1 hss (tungsten based): 18% w, 4% cr, 1% v. good hot hardness, form stability. 8-4-1 hss (molybdenum based): 8% mo, 4% cr, 1% v. efficient as 18-4-1 (half mo needed for same effect as w by weight). excellent toughness, cutting ability. cobalt based hss (super hss): contains 2-15% co. increases hot hardness and wear resistance. very high operating speeds. (table 4.2 effect of alloying elements on hss): tungsten: increases hot hardness, wear resistance, form stability. molybdenum: increases hot hardness, maintains keenness of cutting edge. vanadium: increases wear resistance. cobalt: increases wear resistance and hot hardness. 4.4.3 carbides (cemented carbides/sintered carbides) basic ingredient: tungsten carbide (wc). for steel machining: e.g., 82% wc, 10% titanium carbide (tic), 8% cobalt (binder). very high hardness over wide temperature range, high thermal conductivity. tendency for pressure welds at low speeds; operate at high speeds (>> hss). 4.4.4 abrasives for machining harder materials or where superior finish needed. used in grinding wheels. (discussed later in abrasive machining chapter). 4.4.5 diamond hardest known material. cutting speeds ~50 times hss. for very hard materials (ceramics). can machine 10,000-100,000 pieces vs 300-400 for carbides. performs well at highest speeds, low feeds, low depth of cut. requires excellent machine condition (vibration-free) due to brittleness. not thermally stable, reacts with iron at high temp ($>700^\\circ c$). 4.4.6 cubic boron nitride (cbn) alternative to diamond for ferrous materials. n + b, diamond-like structure. second hardest material. red hardness up to 1000°c. 4.4.7 ucon alloy: 50% columbium (niobium), 30% titanium, 20% tungsten. harder than wc. excellent thermal shock resistance, high hardness & toughness. tool life 3-5 times conventional carbides. 4.4.8 ceramics inexpensive substitute for carbides. main constituent: aluminum oxide (al₂o₃). cuts almost any metal, withstands high heat. very brittle, no shock. extremely fine finishes. speeds twice that of carbides. red hardness ~1200°c. 4.4.9 tipped tools (figure 4.3) alloy steel & hss tools usually one piece. carbides, cbn, diamond tools: cutting edges made from these materials, brazed or clamped to tool shank (due to cost, non-availability, manufacturing difficulty). (fig. 4.3): shows tool insert brazed to shank. clamped inserts can be indexed: rotated to use a new cutting edge when one becomes blunt (e.g., triangular insert has 3 edges, trebling tool life). 4.4.10 coated tools hss tool performance improved by coating cutting edges with carbides (e.g., tic, tin). thin coating (5-7 µm) improves wear resistance, hardness, hot hardness. 4.5 types of tools (figure 4.4) broadly classified: 4.5.1 single point tools (fig. 4.4a): only one cutting edge. used in lathes, shapers, planers. 4.5.2 multipoint tools (fig. 4.4b): more than one cutting edge. each tooth cuts independently. example (fig. 4.4b): milling cutter. other examples: drills, reamers. 4.6 tool geometry size and shape of the tool. depends on operation. (drill is cylindrical, turning tool is prismatic). early cutting tools (figure 4.5) chisel (fig. 4.5a) was likely a first tool, blunt edge. experience led to importance of angles: rake angle, clearance angle, setting angle (fig. 4.5b). these reduce friction, ease chip disposal, reduce force, lower wear, increase tool life. 4.6.1 geometry of single-point turning tool (figure 4.6) consists of shank (body, for holding) and neck (operating end). neck elements: face: surface on which chip impinges and flows. flanks: surfaces facing the work. side (main) flank. end (auxiliary) flank. cutting edges: intersection of face and flanks. side (main) cutting edge: intersection of face and side flank (main sharp edge). end cutting edge: intersection of face and end flank. nose: junction of side and end cutting edges. often has a small nose radius. 4.6.2 cutting tool angles (figure 4.6, 4.7, 4.8) five main angles define geometry. (angles are relative to machined surface). back rake angle (α or commonly just rake angle) (fig. 4.7): angle between tool face and normal to machined surface at cutting edge. positive rake (fig. 4.7a): less tool strength (smaller cross-section), lower cutting forces, sharper edge. good for soft materials. zero rake (fig. 4.7b): negative rake (fig. 4.7c): strongest tool (larger cross-section), higher cutting forces. good for hard/brittle materials, interrupted cuts. side rake angle: angle between tool face and line parallel to tool base, measured in plane perpendicular to base and side cutting edge. gives slope of face from cutting edge. relief angle (clearance angle): angle between tool flank and tangent to machined surface at cutting edge. side relief angle. end relief angle. enables flank to clear workpiece surface, prevents rubbing. side cutting edge angle (lead angle): angle formed by side cutting edge with normal to machined surface. allows tool to contact work back from tip at start of cut. large angle increases force tending to push tool away. end cutting edge angle: angle formed by end cutting edge with machined surface. provides clearance behind nose radius, reduces length of edge in contact. prevents rubbing. (fig. 4.8) illustrates these angles on a tool. 4.7 tool signature sequence of numbers specifying single-point tool geometry. example: 8-14-6-8-8-19-1 (units are typically degrees for angles, mm for nose radius) 8: back rake angle 14: side rake angle 6: end relief angle 8: side relief angle 8: end cutting edge angle 19: side cutting edge angle 1: nose radius 4.8 left hand and right hand tools (figure 4.9) classified by direction of feed. right hand tool (fig. 4.9a): side cutting edge on thumb side when right hand placed on tool, fingers towards nose. cuts from right to left (in a lathe). left hand tool (fig. 4.9b): side cutting edge on thumb side when left hand placed similarly. cuts from left to right. 4.9 orthogonal and oblique cutting (figure 4.10) all metal cutting involves wedge tool, straight cutting edge, relative velocity, chip formation. orthogonal cutting (two-dimensional cutting) (fig. 4.10a): cutting edge is normal (90°) to the direction of tool motion/workpiece velocity. no forces perpendicular to relative motion (idealized). often used for analysis. oblique cutting (three-dimensional cutting) (fig. 4.10b): cutting edge is inclined at an angle (inclination angle) to the direction of tool motion. most common type. cutting forces exist in three mutually perpendicular directions. 4.10 types of chips (figure 4.11) chip formation depends on work material and cutting conditions. continuous chips (fig. 4.11a): from ductile materials (e.g., mild steel). long, single piece. hazardous (wraps on tool/work). broken into smaller pieces by chip breakers (integral to tool or separate). discontinuous or segmental chips (fig. 4.11b): small pieces. from brittle materials (e.g., cast iron). fairly good surface finish, increased tool life. continuous chips with built-up edge (bue) (fig. 4.11c): temperature rise, high pressure → alloying/welding action between hot chip and tool face. weakened material particles weld to tool tip, forming a \"false cutting edge\" (bue). common with aluminum, stainless steels. grows, breaks down, part sticks to chip, part to work surface → rough surface. promoted by low cutting speeds, large depth of cut. highly undesirable. 4.11 thermal aspects in machining (figure 4.12) energy dissipated in cutting converts to heat → raises cutting zone temperature. effects of heat: reduces tool hardness, makes it less wear-resistant. high temp can temper tool, reducing hardness, increasing wear. causes dimensional changes in workpiece (accuracy issues). can distort machine tool accuracy. heat generation depends on: rate of metal cutting, cutting speed, specific heat & thermal conductivity of work/tool. cutting speed: major influence. higher speed → less time for heat dissipation → higher temp. higher specific heat/thermal conductivity of tool/work → lower temp. heat distribution: $$ \\color{white} q = q_1 + q_2 + q_3 + q_4 \\quad (\\text{eq } 4.1) $$ $q_1$: heat with chips. $q_2$: heat into tool. $q_3$: heat into workpiece. $q_4$: heat to surroundings (negligible). typical distribution: chips (80%), tool (10%), workpiece (10%). (fig. 4.12) chips carry most heat, regardless of speed. this is why higher speeds are feasible despite reduced tool life. hot chips can cause burns; handle with care. 4.12 failure of tool tool fails when it ceases to function satisfactorily. catastrophic failure: cutting force exceeds tool material's critical strength. fails without warning. gradual or progressive wear: normal condition. starts with cutting, progresses. 4.12.1 crater wear (figure 4.13): on rake face, away from cutting edge. due to chip rubbing. progresses, weakens cutting edge, can lead to chipping. reduced by chip breakers. 4.12.2 flank wear (figure 4.14): on tool flank. due to continuous contact between newly machined surface and flank (due to depth of cut). 4.13 cutting fluids (coolants) applied to tool-workpiece-chip zone to improve machining performance. cooling is essential, especially at high speeds. functions: absorb/carry away heat (lower cutting zone temp). cool workpiece and tool. reduce friction (lubricate) → reduce heat generation. wash away chips. carry away bue. give fine surface finish. prevent corrosion (tool, work, machine). improvement depends on tool/work material, fluid type, cutting conditions. types: water (excellent coolant, poor lubricant, causes rust). mineral soluble oils added to water improve properties. compressed air, kerosene, liquid air. 4.14 operating conditions in metal cutting parameters: (a) cutting speed, (b) feed, (c) depth of cut. defined differently for different machine tools. 4.14.1 cutting speed (v) distance travelled by work surface in unit time relative to cutting edge (m/min). for rotating workpiece, it's peripheral speed. determined by: machining process, machine tool, tool/work material, cutting fluid, finish, accuracy, tool life. (table 4.3): guide for average cutting speeds (hss tool, various materials). higher speed for lower depth of cut/feed. 4.14.2 feed (f) distance tool advances per revolution of work (mm/rev). sometimes as feed rate (mm/min or mm/s). affects surface finish (low feed → fine finish). depends on workpiece size, tool geometry, materials, fluid, speed, depth of cut. 4.14.3 depth of cut (d) perpendicular distance between machined surface and unmachined/previously machined surface (mm). if 30mm dia cylinder machined with d=1mm, dia becomes 28mm ($30 - 2 \\times 1$). if total material removal > possible depth of cut, multiple cuts (passes) needed. (table 4.4): recommended max feed/depth of cut for hss/carbon steel tools on brass/bronze/cast iron/steel. 4.14.4 material removal rate and machining time determined by total material to remove, speed, feed, depth of cut. machining time: time for one cut/pass. total time = one cut time × no. of cuts. (excludes setup, loading etc.) 4.15 tool life (figure 4.15) heat and localized stresses cause tool wear. tool life (t): time a tool can cut effectively, or time between successive re-sharpenings. cutting speed (v) has more influence than feed/depth of cut. taylor's tool life equation (fig. 4.15 - log t vs log v graph): plot of log(tool life, t in min) vs log(cutting speed, v in m/min) is nearly a straight line. $$ \\color{white} vt^n = c \\quad (\\text{eq } 4.2) $$ `v`: cutting speed (m/min) `t`: tool life (minutes) `c`: constant (depends on tool/work material; intercept on v-axis, i.e., cutting speed for 1-min tool life). `n`: exponent (slope of curve; depends on tool/work material). $$ \\color{white} n = \\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\log v_1 - \\log v_2}{\\log t_2 - \\log t_1} \\quad (\\text{eq } 4.3) $$ (table 4.5): constants n and c for hss/carbide on steel/cast iron. extended taylor's equation (figure 4.16): includes feed (f) and depth of cut (d). $$ \\color{white} vt^n f^{n_1} d^{n_2} = c \\quad (\\text{eq } 4.4) $$ $n_1, n_2$: constants depending on work/tool material. (fig. 4.16): effect of cutting parameters on tool life. slope highest for speed (v), then feed (f), least for depth of cut (d). cutting speed has greatest effect. 4.16 machinability relative ease or difficulty of machining a material under given conditions. judged by: tool life, tool wear, cutting forces/power, dimensional accuracy, surface finish. good machinability: low tool wear, long tool life, good surface finish, low cutting forces. often expressed by comparing cutting speed for a standard tool life (t) to that of a standard material. machinability index: $$ \\color{white} \\text{machinability index} = \\left(\\frac{v_t}{v_s}\\right) \\times 100\\% \\quad (\\text{eq } 4.5) $$ $v_s$: specific cutting speed for tool life t on standard material. $v_t$: cutting speed for same tool life t on test material. affected by machine, tool, cutting conditions, work material. 4.17 solved examples example 4.1 machining cast iron with hss tool. t=50 min at v=100 m/min. n=0.09. (a) find taylor's equation constant c: using $vt^n = c$: $100 \\times (50)^{0.09} = c$. $c = 100 \\times 1.304 \\approx 130.4$. (using $50^{0.09} \\approx 1.304$ from a calculator). note: the pdf derivation giving 142.20 might use logarithmic calculation or a slightly different value for $50^{0.09}$. the equation is $vt^{0.09} = c$. let's use the pdf result: $c \\approx 142.20$. equation: $\\color{white} vt^{0.09} = 142.20$ (b) find tool life (t) at v = 80 m/min: using $vt^n = c$: $80 \\times t^{0.09} = 142.20$. $t^{0.09} = 142.20 / 80 = 1.7775$. $t = (1.7775)^{1/0.09} = (1.7775)^{11.111}$. $t \\approx 596.57$ min. (matches calculation from previous thought process). example 4.2 taylor's equation exponent n=0.5, constant c=300 ($v\\sqrt{t} = 300$). cutting speed reduced by 25%. find change in tool life. let initial speed be $v_1$. initial tool life is $t_1$. new speed $v_2 = v_1 - 0.25 v_1 = 0.75 v_1$. new tool life is $t_2$. using $vt^n = c$: $v_1 t_1^{0.5} = c$ and $v_2 t_2^{0.5} = c$. $v_1 \\sqrt{t_1} = v_2 \\sqrt{t_2}$. $v_1 \\sqrt{t_1} = (0.75 v_1) \\sqrt{t_2}$. $\\sqrt{t_1} = 0.75 \\sqrt{t_2} \\implies t_1 = (0.75)^2 t_2 = 0.5625 t_2$. the ratio of new tool life to old tool life is $\\frac{t_2}{t_1} = \\frac{1}{0.5625} \\approx 1.777...$. change in tool life is $t_2 - t_1 = 1.777 t_1 - t_1 = 0.777 t_1$. percentage increase in tool life is $\\frac{t_2 - t_1}{t_1} \\times 100\\% \\approx 0.777 \\times 100\\% \\approx 77.7\\%$. (pdf states 78%). example 4.3 carbide tool on mild steel. $v_1=50$ m/min, $t_1=100$ min. taylor exponent $n=0.26$. first, find constant c using $v_1 t_1^n = c$: $50 \\times (100)^{0.26} = c$. $100^{0.26} \\approx 3.6308$. $c = 50 \\times 3.6308 \\approx 181.54$. taylor's equation: $\\color{white} vt^{0.26} = 181.54$ (a) speed increased by 25% ($v_2 = 1.25 \\times 50 = 62.5$ m/min). find $t_2$. using $v_2 t_2^n = c$: $62.5 \\times t_2^{0.26} = 181.54$. $t_2^{0.26} = 181.54 / 62.5 \\approx 2.90464$. $t_2 = (2.90464)^{1/0.26} = (2.90464)^{3.846...}$. $t_2 \\approx 60.37$ min. (calculated result. the pdf answer of 42.39 min seems incorrect based on $n=0.26$). (b) find $v_3$ for $t_3 = 180$ min. using $v_3 t_3^n = c$: $v_3 \\times (180)^{0.26} = 181.54$. $180^{0.26} \\approx 4.235$. $v_3 = 181.54 / 4.235 \\approx 42.86$ m/min. (pdf states 42.91 m/min, which is close due to rounding). example 4.4 machinability data for materials a (standard) and b. find relative machinability for t=50 min. for material a: $v_1=100, t_1=25; v_2=150, t_2=10$. using two points to find n: $v_1 t_1^n = v_2 t_2^n \\implies 100 \\times 25^n = 150 \\times 10^n$. $(25/10)^n = 150/100 \\implies 2.5^n = 1.5$. $n \\log(2.5) = \\log(1.5) \\implies n \\times 0.3979 = 0.1761 \\implies n \\approx 0.4425$. (pdf: 0.44) find c: $c = v_1 t_1^n = 100 \\times 25^{0.4425} \\approx 100 \\times 4.89 \\approx 489$. (pdf c = 415.5 using n=0.44 - let's use pdf values for n and c). equation for a: $\\color{white} vt^{0.44} = 415.5$ cutting speed at t=50 min for a ($v_{50}(a)$): $v_{50}(a) \\times 50^{0.44} = 415.5$. $50^{0.44} \\approx 5.616$. $v_{50}(a) = 415.5 / 5.616 \\approx 73.98$ m/min. (pdf: 74 m/min) for material b: $v_1=200, t_1=40; v_2=250, t_2=20$. using two points to find n: $v_1 t_1^n = v_2 t_2^n \\implies 200 \\times 40^n = 250 \\times 20^n$. $(40/20)^n = 250/200 \\implies 2^n = 1.25$. $n \\log(2) = \\log(1.25) \\implies n \\times 0.3010 = 0.0969 \\implies n \\approx 0.3219$. (pdf: 0.32) find c: $c = v_1 t_1^n = 200 \\times 40^{0.3219} \\approx 200 \\times 3.77 \\approx 754$. (pdf c = 651 using n=0.32). equation for b: $\\color{white} vt^{0.32} = 651$ (using pdf's n and c). cutting speed at t=50 min for b ($v_{50}(b)$): $v_{50}(b) \\times 50^{0.32} = 651$. $50^{0.32} \\approx 3.50$. $v_{50}(b) = 651 / 3.50 \\approx 186$ m/min. (pdf: 186 m/min) relative machinability of b (test) to a (standard) at t=50 min: $\\text{machinability index} = \\left(\\frac{v_{50}(b)}{v_{50}(a)}\\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left(\\frac{186}{74}\\right) \\times 100\\%$. index $\\approx 2.5135 \\times 100\\% \\approx 251.35\\%$.

    "textContent": "this chapter delves into the casting process, an ancient manufacturing method. it covers the fundamental principles, the steps involved in sand casting (the most common method), pattern making including materials and allowances, moulding sand properties, types of moulds and moulding operations, the use of cores, gating system design, melting and pouring, solidification concepts, casting yield, common defects, and various special casting processes. 11.1 introduction basic principle: casting utilizes the property of liquids to take the shape of their container. definition: a casting is a metal object made by pouring molten metal into a mould (a cavity of the desired shape) and allowing it to solidify. foundry (foundry shop): the workshop section where metal castings are produced. historical significance: casting is an ancient art (dating back to 5000 bc) used for knives, coins, arrows, etc. example: the largest cannon at jaigarh fort, jaipur (50 tons, 17th century) was cast. modern applications: cylinder blocks, piston rings, machine tool beds, pipes, locomotive wheels. essential in transportation, power, agriculture, etc. why casting is essential (examples): very large components: e.g., a 5m diameter, 10m long component is too large to machine. large features in hard materials: e.g., a 2m diameter hole in a very hard material is impractical to drill; casting is more economical. complicated shapes: machining complex shapes is skill-dependent, slow, and hard to maintain consistency in mass production. casting offers a solution. 11.2 the sand casting process most common method: uses sand moulds. sand is rammed in metallic or wooden flasks. analogy: similar to baking a cake (pour batter into a pan, bake, cool, remove). basic sequence of operations: pattern making: creating a model of the casting. mould making: using the pattern to create a cavity in refractory material (like sand). core making: if internal cavities are needed, cores are made and placed in the mould. melting of metal and pouring: metal is melted and poured into the mould. cooling and solidification: metal cools and solidifies in the shape of the mould cavity. cleaning of castings and inspection: casting is removed, cleaned, and inspected. mould: a cavity in a refractory material (e.g., sand, metal, plaster, ceramics) that withstands high temperatures. sand is common. pattern: a model of the casting, used to form the mould cavity. (see figure 11.1) core: a pre-formed shape (usually of dry sand) placed in the mould to create internal hollow spaces in the casting. (see figure 11.1) (figure 11.1) illustrates a required casting, its pattern, a core box (to make the core), the core itself, and the assembled sand mould in a two-piece flask showing the cavity, core, and gating system. melting: done in furnaces; type and size depend on casting size, quantity, rate, and metal. 11.3 pattern making patterns are the tools used to form the mould cavity. one pattern can make many identical moulds. 11.3.1 pattern materials must be durable for multiple uses. requirements: easily shaped, worked, machined, joined. resistant to wear and corrosion. resistant to chemical action. dimensionally stable (unaffected by temperature/humidity). available and economical. common materials: wood: most common (dried/seasoned). easily available, low weight, low cost, easily shaped. used for >90% of castings. disadvantage: absorbs moisture, leading to distortion; lower life. economical for small quantities; may be the only option for very large castings. metal: for large quantity production, closer tolerances. longer life, free from moisture issues. aluminum is common (light, easy to work, corrosion-resistant); cast iron and brass also used. plastic: low weight, easy formability, smooth surface, durable. don't absorb moisture, dimensionally stable, good corrosion resistance. polystyrene (expanded thermocole): disposable patterns for single castings (e.g., prototypes). soft, easy to make. left in the mould; vaporizes when molten metal is poured, leaving negligible residue. (this is part of the \"lost-foam\" or \"full-mould\" process). 11.3.2 types of patterns (figure 11.2, figure 11.3) solid pattern (single-piece pattern) (fig. 11.2a): one piece, no partings or loose pieces. for simple shapes, cavity usually in the lower flask (drag). split pattern (fig. 11.2b): made in two (or more for multi-piece) parts to ease removal from the mould. split usually at the parting line. halves aligned by dowel pins. loose-piece pattern (fig. 11.2c): has loose pieces for features (projections, undercuts) that would hinder pattern withdrawal. main pattern removed first, then loose pieces are withdrawn through the gap. requires skill, expensive. gated pattern (fig. 11.3a, 11.3b): multiple small patterns attached to a common runner and gates. used for producing many small castings in one mould. often made of metal for strength. match plate pattern (fig. 11.3c): two halves of a split pattern mounted on opposite sides of a \"match plate.\" one side makes the cope, other makes the drag. ensures perfect alignment, easy removal, speeds production, good uniformity. 11.3.3 removable and disposable patterns (figure 11.4) removable pattern: used for multiple identical moulds. sand packed around, pattern withdrawn, cavity filled. (patterns discussed above are mostly removable). disposable pattern: made from polystyrene, etc. sand rammed around, pattern left in the mould. vaporizes on pouring metal. also known as full mould or cavityless method. (fig. 11.4 shows a disposable pattern in sand, and then hot metal replacing it). 11.3.4 pattern allowances patterns are not exact replicas of the final part; they include allowances for metallurgical and mechanical reasons. shrinkage allowance (contraction allowance): extra material added to pattern to compensate for metal shrinking upon solidification and cooling. pattern is made larger than the required casting. amount varies by metal, composition, pouring temp. example: gray cast iron (depends on carbon/silicon), graphite expands on cooling (may need negative allowance). typical: 1-2% for gray iron & non-ferrous, 2-3% for steel. machining allowance (finishing allowance): extra material added to surfaces that will be machined to achieve final size, accuracy, and finish. depends on casting method, size/shape, material, machining process, required accuracy. draft or taper allowance (figure 11.5): taper on vertical faces of removable patterns to allow easy withdrawal from sand without damaging mould walls. example (fig. 11.5): pattern with draft (b) is easier to remove than one without (a). typical: 1° to 3° for wooden patterns. distortion allowance (figure 11.6): for castings prone to distortion (e.g., u-shape, v-shape, long flat sections) due to unequal cooling rates. pattern is intentionally distorted (bent inwards for u-shape, fig. 11.6c) so the casting achieves the correct shape after cooling (fig. 11.6a). fig. 11.6b shows distortion if no allowance. rapping or shake allowance: to loosen pattern for withdrawal, it's rapped (tapped). this enlarges the mould cavity. pattern is made slightly smaller to compensate. important for large/precision castings. amount is hard to evaluate. 11.4 moulding sand principal material for moulds. needs high fusion temp, good thermal stability. ingredients: silica sand grains, clay (binder), moisture, special additives (coal dust for surface finish, fuel oil for mouldability, pearlite for thermal stability). clay + moisture = plasticity, strength. 11.4.1 types of moulding sand natural moulding sand: from riverbeds, pits. also by crushing yellow sandstone. artificial (synthetic) moulding sand: prepared by crushing sandstone, washing, grading. additives develop properties. more flexible property control, but more expensive. classification by use/composition: green sand: silica sand + 18-30% clay + 4-8% water. used moist/undried (\"green\"). moulds used immediately. retains moisture well. dry sand: green sand that's dried/baked after mould preparation. no moisture, yields porous castings. for large castings (>500 kg). metallic flasks needed for baking. loam sand: clay + silica in equal proportions, few additives. used for loam moulding. built up with bricks/iron parts, plastered with loam sand. dried slowly/completely. takes long to prepare. for very large castings. metal mould: made of metal. used for die casting, permanent mould casting, centrifugal casting. (listed under types of sand/moulding material in source, but is a mould type). 11.4.2 properties of moulding sand cohesiveness (strength): ability of sand particles to stick together (due to binder). must withstand compressive/erosive forces of molten metal. moisture/clay content determine strength. chemical resistivity: must be inert, not react with molten metal (especially reactive metals like mg, ti). permeability: allows gases/vapors (from moisture, binders reacting with hot metal) to escape. prevents defects like blowholes. (1 cc water can make 1600 cc steam). flowability: ability of sand to flow into intricate details of the pattern. more significant in machine moulding. adhesiveness: ability of sand to adhere to mould box surfaces, helping retain cavity shape. refractoriness: ability to withstand high temperatures without fusing with molten metal. prevents rough, sand-fused surfaces. (e.g., for steel castings, >1500°c). collapsibility: ability of sand to break down easily after casting solidifies, allowing free metal contraction and easy removal of casting. prevents defects and high fettling (cleaning) costs. 11.5 moulding process of making a mould with the desired cavity using a pattern and suitable material (like sand). pattern (with allowances) is kept in a flask, sand rammed around it, then pattern removed. 11.5.1 types of moulds green sand mould: made with green sand. easy patching/finishing. for small/medium castings. dry sand mould: prepared with green sand, then dried/baked. structure becomes compact. for large castings. metallic flasks needed for baking. loam mould: built up with bricks/iron parts, plastered with loam sand. dried slowly/completely. takes long to prepare. for very large castings. metal mould: made of metal. used for die casting, permanent mould casting, centrifugal casting. (repeated from 11.4.1 classification). 11.5.2 tools used in moulding (figure 11.7) shovel (fig. 11.7a): mixing sand, filling flask. riddle (fig. 11.7b): removing foreign materials from sand. rammer (fig. 11.7c): packing/ramming sand. hand or machine. trowel (fig. 11.7d): smoothing mould surfaces. sprue pin (fig. 11.7e): conical wooden pin to make opening (sprue) for pouring metal. vent rod (fig. 11.7f): making small holes (vents) for gas escape. draw spike (fig. 11.7g): loop-ended tool for drawing pattern from sand. moulding boxes (flasks) (fig. 11.7h): rigid frames (iron/wood) to hold sand. impart rigidity/strength. usually two parts (cope - top, drag - bottom), assembled by pins. middle section (if three) is called cheek. 11.5.3 procedure for making a mould (figure 11.8 - using a split pattern) place first half of pattern on moulding board. place drag (bottom flask) over it (fig. 11.8a). sprinkle parting sand on pattern. riddle moulding sand to cover pattern. press sand around pattern, fill drag completely. ram firmly (not too hard to reduce permeability, not too soft to lose shape). level excess sand with strike rod/trowel. make vent holes near pattern with vent rod. sprinkle parting sand, place another moulding board on top. turn drag upside down. remove top board. smooth surface, apply fine parting sand. place cope (top flask) on drag. align with pins. place second half of pattern on first (using dowel pins). place sprue pin 20-30mm from pattern. fill, ram, vent cope similarly to drag. remove sprue pin. scoop funnel shape (pouring basin) at top of sprue opening. (fig. 11.8c shows final mould). lift cope carefully. moisten sand edges around pattern with swab. drive draw spike into pattern, rap lightly, lift pattern out (from both cope and drag). cut gate (passage) between sprue opening and mould cavity. assemble mould: place cope back on drag. blow off loose sand. a riser (extra cavity, often in cope) may be cut to store extra metal to compensate for shrinkage. 11.5.4 moulding processes bench moulding: for small, light moulds on benches. green, dry, or skin-dried moulds. usually loose-piece patterns. slow, laborious (hand ramming). floor moulding: for larger moulds, done on foundry floor. medium/large moulds, green/dry sand. slow. pit moulding: for very big castings not fittable in flasks. mould cavity in a pit in foundry floor. sand moulds. 11.5.5 types of moulding operations hand moulding: all operations manual (sand ramming). slow, laborious, hard to get uniform hardness. low initial cost (no machines, simple tools). can make difficult shapes not possible by machine. machine moulding: for faster, uniform quality moulds in mass production. operations like ramming, pattern withdrawal, finishing done by machines. uniform hardness. fast, homogeneous, any size. high initial cost. difficult shapes not always possible. 11.6 cores (figure 11.1) used for holes or internal cavities in castings. a sand shape/form making the contour of a casting for which no provision is in the pattern. produced separately, baked for strength, placed in mould in core prints (cavities in mould for core support). made from sand, metal, plaster, ceramics. acts as an obstruction; molten metal doesn't fill core space, creating hollow casting. surrounded by molten metal, so faces severe thermal/mechanical conditions. ejected/broken after solidification. 11.6.1 properties of core strong (to retain shape during handling). resist erosion by molten metal. permeable to gases. high refractoriness. good surface finish (replicates onto casting). 11.6.2 core making made of clay-free silica sand + binders + water + ingredients = core mix. packed into core box (cavity of desired core shape, fig. 11.1). operations: core sand preparation: homogeneous mixing for uniform strength. core making: fill core box, ram. remove core. manual or machine. core baking: removes moisture, imparts strength. proper baking essential. under-baked: release gases, cause defects. over-baked: collapse too early, break before metal solidifies. 11.7 gating system (figure 11.9, 11.10, 11.11) passageways for molten metal to enter mould cavity. influences casting quality. components (fig. 11.9): pouring cup/basin: reservoir where metal is poured; allows smooth flow into sprue. reduces mould erosion. sprue: channel feeding metal to runner. straight sprue (fig. 11.10a): metal contracts, pulls from walls (low pressure zone, aspiration of gas/air). tapered sprue (fig. 11.10b): metal stays in contact with walls, reduces turbulence, eliminates aspiration. preferred. sprue base (sprue well): reservoir at sprue bottom. reduces falling metal momentum, changes flow direction uniformly into runner, reduces erosion. runner: channel taking metal from sprue base, distributes to gates. may not be needed for single gate. gate (ingate): channel connecting runner to mould cavity. types of gates (fig. 11.11): top gate (fig. 11.11a): metal falls directly into cavity. ensures directional solidification. disadvantages: erodes mould, splashing, turbulence. (used for vertically cast hollow cylinders). a strainer core can be used at the pouring cup. bottom gate (fig. 11.11b): metal enters from bottom. no scouring/splashing. disadvantages: unfavorable temperature gradient (difficult directional solidification), metal might freeze and choke flow. used for heavy castings. parting line gate (parting gate) (fig. 11.11c): metal enters at parting plane. common. riser (feeder/feed head): hole/cavity in cope allowing molten metal to rise above casting's highest point. feeds molten metal to compensate for shrinkage during solidification. allows escape of steam, gas, air. indicates when mould is full. shrinkage in riser is harmless as riser is not part of casting. 11.8 melting and pouring of metal metal melted in a furnace before pouring. molten metal state greatly influences final casting quality. furnace selection depends on amount/type of metal (e.g., cupola for cast iron, open-hearth for steel). 11.8.1 cupola furnace (figure 11.12) refractory-lined vertical steel vessel for melting cast iron. cheap, high thermal efficiency, low operating cost, versatile, easy operation. operation: start: wood on sand bed, then coke. ignite. charge (from charging door): alternate layers of metal, flux (limestone, sodium carbonate), coke. melting ratio (metal:fuel) = 4:1 to 12:1. flux: forms slag to remove impurities, retards iron oxidation. soaking period (30 min-1 hr): preheats charge. air blast turned on (through tuyeres). combustion raises temp, melts metal. molten metal accumulates at tapping hole. slag hole opened first, slag removed. tap hole opened intermittently, molten metal collected in ladle, poured into moulds. (fig. 11.12 components): spark arrester, charging door, stack zone, preheating zone, steel shell, refractory lining, melting zone, wind box, reducing zone, combustion zone, tuyeres, well, fettling hole, tapping hole, slag hole, drop bottom, sand bottom. layers shown: coke, flux, metal. 11.9 directional solidification (figure 11.13) molten metal shrinks in volume during cooling/solidification. three stages of contraction: liquid contraction: cooling from pouring temp to solidification temp. solidification contraction: changing from liquid to solid (losing latent heat). solid contraction: cooling from solidification temp to room temp. uneven cooling (due to varying section thickness, heat loss rates) causes some parts to solidify faster. this can lead to voids/cavities. directional solidification: for a sound casting, solidification should start from thinnest/farthest parts and move progressively towards risers. risers should be last to solidify, feeding shrinkage in the casting. hot spot (fig. 11.13a): region a in t-junction is thicker, cools last. if b, c, d solidify first, no liquid metal available for a's shrinkage, causing void (fig. 11.13b). solution (fig. 11.13c): place riser above hot spot (a). riser feeds a, void forms in riser (harmless). 11.10 solidification time casting is slow (moulding, melting, pouring, solidification, cleaning). solidification time (t): based on cooling rate (function of volume v and surface area a). $$ \\color{white} t = c \\left(\\frac{v}{a}\\right)^2 \\quad (\\text{eq } 11.1) \\quad (\\text{chvorinov's rule}) $$ where `c` = constant (depends on mould material, metal properties, temp). cube-shaped mould solidifies faster than spherical mould of same volume (sphere has min a/v ratio for a given v, so max v/a). 11.11 casting yield not all poured metal becomes casting; some remains in riser, sprue, runner, gates (gating system, fig. 11.9). some lost in melting. casting yield (cy): (weight of casting / actual mass of metal entered mould cavity) × 100% $$ \\color{white} c_y = \\frac{w_c}{w_c + w_g} \\times 100\\% \\quad (\\text{eq } 11.2) $$ where wc = weight of casting, wg = weight of material in gating system (sprue, runner, gate, riser, etc.). gating system material is removed, cleaned, remelted. 11.12 defects in sand casting reduce output, increase cost. caused by single or multiple factors. 11.12.1 blowholes: smooth-walled round voids/cavities, open to surface. causes: entrapped gas bubbles, excessive moisture in sand, low permeability, hard ramming, gas-producing ingredients. 11.12.2 shrinkage defects (figure 11.13): voids due to volumetric shrinkage if feeding is inadequate. prevention: adequate feeding, gating design for directional solidification. 11.12.3 hot tears: internal/external cracks on casting surface. causes: hindered contraction immediately after solidification (when metal is weak). poor design (abrupt section changes, no proper corner radii), hard ramming, too much metal shrinkage. 11.12.4 misruns, cold shuts, and pour short: misrun: incomplete casting (metal fails to fill entire cavity). causes: thin sections, cold metal. cold shut: discontinuity/seam where two streams of cold metal meet but don't fuse. pour short: cavity not completely filled due to insufficient metal. 11.12.5 inclusions: undesirable foreign material (oxides, slag, dirt) in metal. prevention: skim molten metal, blow off loose sand before closing moulds. 11.13 special casting processes sand moulds are single-use. permanent moulds save time/labor. sand casting may not give desired accuracy/finish. advantages over sand casting: greater dimensional accuracy. higher production rates. lower labor costs. better surface finish. minimum need for further machining. ability to produce extremely thin sections. disadvantage: high initial investment. 11.13.1 plaster mould casting process (ceramic mould casting) (figure 11.14) for lead, tin, bronze alloys. moulds from plaster (gypsum). patterns from wood, metal, plastic. process (fig. 11.14): prepare plaster slurry (gypsum + water) (fig. 11.14a). sets by recrystallization. pour slurry over metal pattern in cope (fig. 11.14b). vibrate for full cavity fill. initial set (few mins), remove pattern. make drag similarly. dry cope/drag in oven (200-400°c). assemble hot mould halves quickly (fig. 11.14c). pour molten metal immediately (minimizes moisture absorption). remove casting with high-pressure water jet. accuracy: 0.008–0.01 mm. products: aircraft parts, ornaments. 11.13.2 shell mould casting process (corning process or c-process) (figure 11.15) replaces sand moulds with thin (0.3-0.6 mm) rigid shells of uniform wall thickness. shells: dry silica sand + phenolic resins. formed into thin half-mould shells, clamped/adhesived for pouring. steps (fig. 11.15): heat metal pattern (200-250°c) (fig. 11.15a). clamp hot pattern over open dump box filled with sand-resin mix (fig. 11.15b). invert dump box; mix falls on hot pattern (fig. 11.15c). mix softens, fuses, forms shell. resin gets sticky, then hardens (30 secs). turn dump box over; excess mix falls back (fig. 11.15d). shell adheres to pattern. heat pattern + shell in oven (300°c, 1 min). remove shell from pattern (using ejector pins) (fig. 11.15e). assemble two or more shell pieces to make complete mould (fig. 11.15f). pour metal. good surface finish, dimensional accuracy. high initial investment. for small castings (gears, bearing caps, bushings). 11.13.3 permanent mould casting process (figure 11.16) uses permanent moulds (metal or refractory coated metal), metal poured by gravity. mould has two parts (like cope/drag). reusable after cleaning (unlike sand casting). better mechanical properties (rapid solidification -> finer grain). smoother surface, closer tolerances than sand casting. reduces secondary finishing. no evolved gases (unlike sand), so sounder castings, pressure-tight. moulds: high-alloy iron/steel. life: up to 120,000+ castings. products: kitchenware, automobile pistons. (fig. 11.16 shows a typical permanent mould with metal core, sprue, clamp). steps: preheat mould (120-250°c). apply refractory wash/coating to surfaces contacting metal. insert cores (if any), close mould. pour molten metal via gating system. allow solidification. open mould, remove cores/loose members, remove casting. trim gates/risers. 11.13.4 die-casting process (figure 11.17, 11.18) uses permanent moulds called dies. metal injected under high pressure (10-210 mpa), not gravity fed. uniform structure, good surface finish & dimensional accuracy. often eliminates post-machining. types: hot chamber die-casting (fig. 11.17): piston in extreme left, cylinder fills with molten metal from surrounding \"hot chamber\" (part of machine, often submerged in melt). piston moves forward, injects metal under pressure into die. metal solidifies quickly, die opens, casting ejected. piston returns, cylinder refills. fast (up to 1000 cycles/hr). for low melting temp materials (zinc, tin, lead alloys). cold chamber die-casting (fig. 11.18): melting unit is separate. molten metal ladled into \"cold chamber\" (cylinder). ram/plunger forces metal into die cavity. generally slower than hot chamber. differences from hot chamber: melting unit not integral. poured metal in cold chamber is at lower temp. higher pressure requirements. suitable for higher melting point alloys (al, mg, cu-based). 11.13.5 continuous casting process (figure 11.19) for castings of large length, uniform cross-section (squares, rectangles, hexagons). change mould for different cross-sections. process: molten metal poured into one end of open-ended metal mould, cooled rapidly to solidify, solidified product continuously removed from other end. (fig. 11.19): holding furnace, molten metal flows from bottom (prevents impurities) into mould with cooling jacket (circulating water). withdrawing rolls pull solidified casting down at controlled speed. saw cuts to desired lengths. 11.13.6 centrifugal casting process (figure 11.20) uses centrifugal force. permanent metal mould revolves at high speed (horizontal, vertical, or inclined). molten metal poured, thrown to outer surface of mould cavity by centrifugal force. distributes liquid metal over inner mould surfaces. solidifies as hollow cylinder. wall thickness controlled by amount of metal poured. mould forms outer surface/length only. different wall thicknesses from same mould. centrifugal force keeps casting hollow (no need for cores). good quality, dimensional accuracy, external surface detail. products: pipes, gun barrels, bushings. 11.14 advantages and limitations of the casting processes advantages: no restriction on metal/alloy type (can cast brittle like cast iron, or hard materials). no restriction on component size (grams to tons). economical for job production and mass production. disadvantages: high energy consumption (e.g., 2000 kwh for 1 ton steel castings). highly labor-intensive. high raw material quantum (e.g., for 1 ton steel casting: 2.2 tons metal, 0.3 ton parting sand, 4 tons moulding sand, fuel, etc.). needs large buildings, handling, space, inventory. more manufacturing time than machining. high environmental pollution. 11.15 selection of casting process factors to consider if a product can be made by multiple casting processes: quantity to be produced. product requirements (surface finish, accuracy, complexity). physical properties of material. process capability to meet requirements. initial investment and operational costs. other: environmental pollution, skilled operator availability, automation possibility. 11.16 solved examples example 11.1 cast iron job (fig 11.21: 80x50x20 mm). wooden pattern. machining allowance 2mm/side, shrinkage 2%, taper 1°. basic pattern dimensions (with machining allowance): length = 80 + 2*2 = 84 mm width = 50 + 2*2 = 54 mm height = 20 + 2*2 = 24 mm draft (on 24mm vertical sides): x = 24 * tan(1°) ≈ 0.419 mm. top surface dimensions before shrinkage (with draft added to the size including machining allowance): width_top = 54 + 2*0.419 ≈ 54.838 mm length_top = 84 + 2*0.419 ≈ 84.838 mm dimensions after shrinkage (2%): width (54mm base) becomes 54 * 1.02 = 55.08 mm (say 55.1 mm). width (54.838mm top) becomes 54.838 * 1.02 ≈ 55.93 mm (say 55.9 mm). length (84mm base) becomes 84 * 1.02 = 85.68 mm (say 85.7 mm). length (84.838mm top) becomes 84.838 * 1.02 ≈ 86.53 mm (say 86.5 mm). height (24mm) becomes 24 * 1.02 = 24.48 mm (say 24.5 mm). (fig. 11.23) shows final pattern dimensions: base 85.7 x 55.1 mm; top 86.5 x 55.9 mm; height 24.5 mm. example 11.2 steel job (fig 11.24: l=80, w=40, h=30 mm). wooden pattern. machining 3mm/side, shaking 1mm on l&w, shrinkage 3%. dimensions after machining allowance: l = 80 + 2*3 = 86 mm w = 40 + 2*3 = 46 mm h = 30 + 2*3 = 36 mm (fig. 11.25) dimensions after shrinkage (3%): l = 86 * 1.03 = 88.58 mm w = 46 * 1.03 = 47.38 mm h = 36 * 1.03 = 37.08 mm (fig. 11.26) dimensions after shaking (-1mm on l&w, height unaffected): l = 88.58 - 1 = 87.58 mm w = 47.38 - 1 = 46.38 mm h = 37.08 mm (fig. 11.27 - final pattern dimensions) example 11.3 suggest patterns for jobs in fig 11.28. large number of identical small parts for (d). (a) hollow rectangular bar: loose-piece pattern (if cast horizontally). or solid/split pattern (if cast vertically, core needed for hollow). (b) spool-like shape: split pattern (due to geometry). (c) solid cylinder: solid or split pattern. if large (0.4m dia, 1m length), split pattern. very large, solid pattern with pit moulding. (d) small block (large numbers): gated pattern or match plate pattern (for identical pieces, mass production). example 11.4 cubical steel casting (100mm side) using aluminum master pattern. wooden pattern for al master pattern. shrinkage: steel 0.0210 mm/mm, al 0.013 mm/mm.

(fig. 11.30) example 11.5 three castings (cube, sphere, cylinder l/d=0.5) of same weight/material. find cooling time ratio. solidification time `t = c * (v / a)²`. since v and c are same for all, the ratio of solidification times is the square of the inverse ratio of their surface areas for the same volume. let v be the common volume. sphere: volume $v = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_1^3$, area $a_s = 4\\pi r_1^2$. cylinder: volume $v = \\pi r_2^2 l_2$. given $l_2/d_2 = 0.5$, so $l_2 = 0.5 \\times (2r_2) = r_2$. volume $v = \\pi r_2^3$. area $a_c = 2\\pi r_2^2 + 2\\pi r_2 l_2 = 2\\pi r_2^2 + 2\\pi r_2 (r_2) = 4\\pi r_2^2$. cube: volume $v = l_3^3$, area $a_{cb} = 6l_3^2$. from the volumes: $r_2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{1/3} r_1$, $l_3 = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\right)^{1/3} r_1$. relating areas: $a_c = 4\\pi r_2^2 = 4\\pi \\left(\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{1/3} r_1\\right)^2 = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{2/3} r_1^2$. $a_{cb} = 6l_3^2 = 6 \\left(\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\right)^{1/3} r_1\\right)^2 = 6 \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi\\right)^{2/3} r_1^2$. $a_s = 4\\pi r_1^2$. ratio of solidification times $t \\propto (v/a)^2 \\propto (1/a)^2$ (since v is constant). so, $\\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)^2$. ratio of cooling time of sphere to cylinder: $\\frac{t_{sphere}}{t_{cylinder}} = \\left(\\frac{a_{cylinder}}{a_{sphere}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{4\\pi (\\frac{4}{3})^{2/3} r_1^2}{4\\pi r_1^2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{4/3} \\approx (1.333)^{1.333} \\approx 1.46$. (pdf states 1.47) ratio of cooling time of sphere to cube: $\\frac{t_{sphere}}{t_{cube}} = \\left(\\frac{a_{cube}}{a_{sphere}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{6(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi)^{2/3} r_1^2}{4\\pi r_1^2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2\\pi^{1/3}}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)^2$. using the pdf's direct ratio from the provided solution: $\\frac{t_{sphere}}{t_{cube}} = 1.54$. ratio of cooling time of cylinder to cube: $\\frac{t_{cylinder}}{t_{cube}} = \\left(\\frac{a_{cube}}{a_{cylinder}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{6(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi)^{2/3} r_1^2}{4\\pi (\\frac{4}{3})^{2/3} r_1^2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{6}{4} \\frac{(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi)^{2/3}}{(\\frac{4}{3})^{2/3}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{2} \\pi^{2/3}\\right)^2$. using the pdf's direct ratio from the provided solution: $\\frac{t_{cylinder}}{t_{cube}} = 1.05$. the exact derivation of the numerical values 1.54 and 1.05 from basic dimensions requires careful handling of the volume constraint across the shapes, and might involve simplifying the $(v/a)^2$ terms differently than just taking the ratio of areas derived from a common $r_1$. however, the principle is based on chvorinov's rule, and the ratios provided in the source are presented as standard results for shapes of equal volume.",

    "textContent": "this chapter explores metal forming, a method of shaping components by applying external forces to cause plastic deformation. it contrasts forming with machining and casting, classifies forming processes based on applied stresses, and delves into specific bulk deformation processes like rolling, extrusion, and forging, including their variations, terminologies, equipment, parameters, and examples. 12.1 introduction metal forming: a process where desired size and shape are obtained by plastically deforming metals under external forces. also known as bulk deformation processes (due to large forces) or plastic working (deformation in the plastic state). example: blacksmith forging - hammering heated iron (compressive force). performed on metal forming machines. can be done hot (material heated to soften) or cold. classification by stress type: compressive: forging, rolling, extrusion. tensile: stretch forming, creep forming, vacuum forming. shearing: shearing, blanking, fine blanking. combined tensile & compressive: wire drawing, deep drawing, ironing. comparison with machining/casting (using fig 12.1 component): machining: requires removing large amounts of material (chips), involves material loss, skill-dependent for contours. casting: involves pattern/mould making, melting, pouring, solidification, potential material waste (risers/gating), may need further machining. forming (e.g., stretch forming over a die, fig 12.2): no material loss, potentially less skilled operation needed, fewer steps. material limitation: metal forming generally requires ductile materials; brittle materials cannot be shaped this way. machining/casting work for most materials. 12.2 rolling processes shaping metals/alloys by passing them between rolls. causes plastic deformation: reduces thickness, increases length and width. widely used (~90% of metal products). developed late 1500s. products: rails, girders, plates, sheets, strips. 12.2.1 rolling operation (figure 12.3) ingot (metal piece) passed between two rolls rotating oppositely. space between rolls adjusted for desired thickness. rolls squeeze ingot, reducing thickness/cross-section, increasing width/length. structural changes: grains elongate in rolling direction. material velocity higher at exit than entry. hot rolling: grains start refining after passing stress zone. cold rolling: grains retain elongated shape. arc of contact (ab): distance metal is in contact with rolls. angle of contact (angle of bite) (aob): angle subtended by arc ab at roll center. friction: between rolls and metal provides grip to draw metal through. higher friction allows greater reduction but increases force/power needs and can damage surface. lubricants used for low friction. pressure distribution (figure 12.4) varies along arc of contact. minimum at entry (a) and exit (b). maximum at a point c (neutral point or no-slip point) between a and b. from a to c: metal moves slower than roll surface. from c to b: metal moves faster than roll surface. *(why rolling vs stretching?)* stretching causes non-uniform deformation and may cause fracture beyond yield point. 12.2.2 terminology used in rolling ingot: initial cast product (circular, square, etc.). bloom: first product from hot rolling ingot. square cross-section, area > 225 cm². billet: minimum cross-section ~4cm x 4cm. can be hot worked ingot or casting suitable for hot working. slab: hot rolled ingot, area > 100 cm², width at least twice thickness. plate: rolled intermediate product, thickness > 6 mm. sheet: rolled intermediate product, thickness < 6 mm. strip: rolled product, thickness < 6 mm, width < 300 mm. (sheet width > 300 mm). 12.2.3 rolling mills (arrangement of rolls) (figure 12.5) two-high rolling mill (fig. 12.5a): two rolls, rotate one direction. workpiece passed through, taken over top, returned for next pass. two-high reversing mill (fig. 12.5b): rolls can reverse direction. rolling done in both directions. three-high rolling mill (fig. 12.5c): top/bottom rolls driven, middle rotates by friction. material rolled between bottom/middle pair, then lifted and rolled between top/middle pair. four-high rolling mill (fig. 12.5d): two small diameter working rolls supported by two large diameter back-up rolls. provides rigidity, reduces power (less friction area). used for sheet rolling. continuous (tandem) mill (fig. 12.5e): multiple sets of rolls (stands) in series. for high production. roll speeds synchronized as strip velocity increases at each stand. has uncoiler (feeds stock) and windup reel (coils product). planetary rolling mill (fig. 12.5f): reduces slabs to strips in single pass. multiple small rollers (\"planets\") around large back-up rolls. universal rolling mill (fig. 12.5g): two pairs of rolls: one horizontal (like two-high), one vertical. rolls edges simultaneously. for beams, i-sections, plates needing finished edges. 12.2.4 rolling parameters absolute draught (draft) (δt): initial thickness (t₁) - final thickness (t₂). $$ \\color{white} \\delta_t = t_1 - t_2 \\quad (\\text{eq } 12.1) $$ maximum possible draft (δmax): determined by friction (µ) and roll radius (r). $$ \\color{white} \\delta_{\\text{max}} = \\mu^2 r \\quad (\\text{eq } 12.2) $$ (higher friction/radius allows more reduction). absolute elongation (δl): final length (l₂) - initial length (l₁). $$ \\color{white} \\delta_l = l_2 - l_1 \\quad (\\text{eq } 12.3) $$ absolute spread (δb): final breadth (b₂) - initial breadth (b₁). $$ \\color{white} \\delta_b = b_2 - b_1 \\quad (\\text{eq } 12.4) $$ relative draught (rt): (absolute draught / initial thickness) x 100. $$ \\color{white} r_t = \\frac{\\delta_t}{t_1} \\times 100\\% \\quad (\\text{eq } 12.5) $$ elongation coefficient (µl): ratio of final length to initial length. $$ \\color{white} \\mu_l = \\frac{l_2}{l_1} \\quad (\\text{eq } 12.6) $$ angle of contact (α): angle subtended by arc of contact ab at roll center. $$ \\color{white} \\cos \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{\\delta_t}{d} \\quad (\\text{eq } 12.7) $$ (where d = roll diameter). coefficient of friction (µ): $$ \\color{white} \\mu = \\tan \\alpha \\quad (\\text{eq } 12.8) $$ 12.3 thread rolling (figure 12.6) cold working process. cylindrical workpiece (diameter ≈ pitch diameter) rotated between hard dies with negative thread contour. can use two flat dies (one stationary, one reciprocating). versatile: can roll different threads simultaneously, knurling, left/right hand threads. 12.4 extrusion process reducing cross-section of a metal block (billet) by forcing it through a die orifice under high pressure. principle like squeezing toothpaste. orifice shape determines product shape. can achieve high reduction ratios (e.g., 100:1 for soft metals). hot extrusion: done at high temps (50-75% of melting point). cold extrusion: done at room temp or slightly elevated temp. high temps/pressures affect die life; good lubrication needed. extrudable metals: lead, tin, al alloys, copper, titanium, molybdenum, vanadium, low carbon steel. products (fig 12.7): complex cross-sections, collapsible tubes, cans, cylinders, window frames, railings, structural parts, gear blanks. difficult to extrude: stainless steel (high yield strength, sticks to die). 12.4.1 types of extrusion direct (forward) extrusion (figure 12.8): billet in container. ram pushes billet. metal flows through die in same direction as ram motion. small discard amount left. indirect (backward) extrusion (figure 12.9): die mounted on hollow ram. ram pushes die into billet. metal flows through die opening in direction opposite to ram motion (through hollow ram). no friction between billet and container wall (billet is stationary relative to container). impact extrusion (figure 12.12, 12.13): cold extrusion, higher speeds. punch strikes unheated slug in die cavity with single blow. metal squirts up around punch (backward flow). high pressure fills cavity instantly. forms tube-shaped part (fig 12.12). for toothpaste tubes (fig 12.13): hole punched in blank center, die shapes neck. tube blown off ram by compressed air. low cost, excellent surface quality, high production rates (millions/year). applications: collapsible tubes, ointments, shell cases, soft drink cans. side extrusion (figure 12.14): material movement perpendicular to ram motion. metal flows sideways. requires very high force. mostly for non-ferrous or highly plastic metals (lead). example shows cable producing seamless tube. tube extrusion (figure 12.15): form of direct extrusion. uses a mandrel to shape inside of tube. die containing mandrel pushed through billet, then press stem extrudes metal through die and around mandrel. 12.4.2 extrusion pressure in direct and indirect extrusion (figure 12.10) extrusion pressure = extrusion force / billet cross-sectional area. initial rapid pressure rise (compressing billet to fill container). direct: pressure peaks (breakthrough pressure), then decreases as billet length reduces (less friction). indirect: pressure relatively constant after initial rise (no billet-container friction). represents stress needed for deformation. indirect seems attractive, but limited by need for hollow ram (limits size/pressure). complex process. rapid pressure rise at end of stroke (difficult to push last bit). extrusion halted before this. direction of flow (figure 12.11): initially diagonal, becomes perpendicular to ram near end of cycle. 12.5 forging processes shaping metal (usually heated) by plastic deformation using compressive force (hammer blows or press). process: metal heated (elastic properties disappear, becomes soft), shaped by pressure following path of least resistance. effects: refines grain structure, improves physical properties (strength, ductility, toughness) compared to base metal. yields high strength-to-weight ratio parts. consistent products, no porosity/voids/inclusions (unlike casting). finishing operations don't expose defects. good surface for coating. ancient technique (4000-8000 bc). produces discrete parts (unlike continuous rolling products). why forge? (vs cast/machine): if high strength, shock/vibration resistance needed. properties uniform, predictable. often achieved by hot working (rolling or forging). typical products (figure 12.16): various discrete parts shown. 12.5.1 forging materials must be ductile. readily forged: low/medium carbon steel, wrought iron, copper alloys, al alloys, mg alloys. difficult: high carbon/alloy steel, stainless steel, nickel alloys. usually starts from bars or billets (round/rectangular). 12.5.2 classification of forging operations open die forging (figure 12.17): deformation between flat or simple shaped dies. workpiece not fully enclosed. simplest example: upsetting (compressing height, increasing diameter). workpiece bulges (barrel shape) due to friction at die interface and faster cooling of surfaces. no barreling if friction=0 (hypothetical). closed die forging (impression die forging) (figure 12.18): workpiece deformed between two die halves containing impressions of final shape. workpiece enclosed in cavity. high pressure forces metal to fill cavity. excess metal forms flash (thin extrusion at parting line), acts as seal, ensures cavity fills. flash trimmed later. requires lubricant (prevents sticking, thermal insulation). produces precision parts, close tolerances. 12.5.3 types of forging operations hand forging (figure 12.19): blacksmith method: heated metal shaped by repeated hand hammer blows on an anvil. positioning/turning part manually. fuller (rounded chisel edge) used to draw out metal. quality depends on smith's skill. simple shapes only. (horseshoes). drop forging (drop hammer forging) (figure 12.20): mechanized hammer. heated bar/billet hammered into die cavities. die halves on ram and anvil. ram raised (e.g., compressed air), falls by gravity. used for copper alloys, steel, titanium, refractory alloys. hydraulic hammer shown. press forging: slow squeezing action using a press (mechanical or hydraulic). transfers force uniformly/gradually through bulk. for large forgings (up to 125 kg, 3m long). more accurate than drop forging. slower action allows metal flow time. needs ejectors, venting (escape of air/lubricant). quieter than drop forging. more energy transmitted to work (less absorbed by machine/foundation). mechanical presses: 25-100 strokes/min, 100-12,000 tons force. used for al, mg, be alloys, bronze, brass. 12.5.4 rotary swaging (figure 12.21) forging process for shaping round bars/tubes. workpiece fed into rapidly rotating dies housed in a cage. as cage rotates, hammers contact rollers, giving blows to workpiece through dies. dies reciprocate at high frequency, deforming workpiece. high production rate compared to other forging methods. 12.6 solved examples example 12.1 rolling 30mm stock to 10mm (stage 1, α=40°), then 10mm to 5mm (stage 2, α=30°). find min roll diameter (d) and friction coeff (µ). stage 1: $t_1=30$, $t_2=10$ ⇒ $\\delta_t = 20$ mm. $\\alpha = 40^\\circ$. using $\\cos \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{\\delta_t}{d}$: $\\cos 40^\\circ = 1 - \\frac{20}{d}$ $0.766 = 1 - \\frac{20}{d} \\implies \\frac{20}{d} = 1 - 0.766 = 0.234$ $d = \\frac{20}{0.234} \\approx 85.47$ mm. (pdf: 85.49 mm) using $\\mu = \\tan \\alpha$: $\\mu = \\tan 40^\\circ \\approx 0.839$. (pdf: 0.84) stage 2: $t_1=10$, $t_2=5$ ⇒ $\\delta_t = 5$ mm. $\\alpha = 30^\\circ$. using $\\cos \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{\\delta_t}{d}$: $\\cos 30^\\circ = 1 - \\frac{5}{d}$ $0.866 = 1 - \\frac{5}{d} \\implies \\frac{5}{d} = 1 - 0.866 = 0.134$ $d = \\frac{5}{0.134} \\approx 37.31$ mm.

    "textContent": "this chapter focuses on methods to join two or more parts of the same or different materials to create a final product or structure. it covers the classification of joining processes (permanent, temporary, semi-permanent), and then delves into specific methods like welding (arc, gas, resistance, tig), soldering, brazing, and mechanical fasteners (threaded and non-threaded). 15.1 introduction (figure 15.1, 15.2) many products are made by joining individual parts (e.g., furniture, computers, bridges, towers). it's often impractical to make complex items as a single piece. joining is essential when: manufacturing a desired system (e.g., fig 15.1: a complex shaft best made by joining three simpler pieces, especially for small batches, to save on machining/casting costs). as an alternative to other processes. in product assembly. for repairing broken/worn parts. example (fig 15.1): a stepped shaft (a) can be made by machining a large bar (wastage) or casting (requires patterns, furnace). for small batches, joining three simpler machined parts (b) is more economical with minimal wastage. example (fig 15.2): a complex tubular part is very difficult to make as a single piece; better to make parts and join them. common joining processes: welding, soldering, brazing, mechanical fastening. 15.2 classification of joining processes based on type of joint produced: permanent joint: properties similar to base metal; parts become one piece. cannot be separated without damage/destruction. (e.g., welding, adhesive bonding). temporary joint: easily dismantled without damaging parts. (e.g., most mechanical fasteners). semi-permanent joint: allows separation with some difficulty, but not normally dismantled. (e.g., rivets). based on process used for making the joint: welding brazing (considered permanent, but can be dismantled by heating for repair) soldering (considered permanent, but can be dismantled by heating for repair) mechanical fasteners (rivets, bolts, nuts, screws, etc.) adhesive bonding choice of process depends on: application, loads/stresses, joint design, materials, size/shape. (figure 15.3) shows examples of joints: soldered butt joint (a), butt joint with weld bead (b), corner joint with screw (c), lap joint with rivet (d), lap joint with fillet weld (e), assembly with bolt and nut (f). 15.3 welding process metallurgically joining two metal pieces by fusing them to form essentially a single piece. technology is >2500 years old. most metals (even plastics/glasses with proper techniques) are weldable. heat, pressure, or both melt metal edges to fuse permanently. filler material may be used. heat sources: electric arc, electric current (resistance), gas flame, chemical reaction. terminology: base metal: workpieces to be joined. weld bead (bead): material deposited by welding, appears separate from base metal. (fig. 15.3b). puddle: portion of base metals at joint melted during welding. weld pass: movement of welding torch from one end of joint to other, resulting in a joint. tack weld: temporary small weld at ends to hold workpieces together during welding. 15.3.1 types of welding processes (based on heat source) arc welding: heat from electric arc. gas welding: heat from flame (burning oxygen + combustible gas like acetylene). other specialized processes like resistance welding (heat from electric current through parts) are beyond scope. 15.3.2 pre-welding requirements base metals must be clean (free from dirt, grease, oil, moisture) for proper fusion and high-quality welds. joint edges must be prepared for proper joint formation. 15.3.3 types of welding joints (figure 15.4) defines relative positions of pieces. (position of weld marked with 'x'). butt joint (fig. 15.4a): pieces joined edge to edge. lap joint (fig. 15.4b): pieces overlap. corner joint (fig. 15.4c, d): pieces joined at an angle at their edges. t-joint (fig. 15.4e): one piece perpendicular to another, forming a 't'. 15.3.4 edge preparations for welding (figure 15.5 - for butt joints) essential for complete penetration and sound welds, especially in thick plates. square faces (fig. 15.5a): for thin plates. heat may not melt entire thickness if too thick. root: max thickness weldable with square faces. grooves (for thicker plates): single-v (fig. 15.5b), single-u (fig. 15.5d): cut leaving a root thickness. allows deeper penetration. double-v (fig. 15.5c), double-u (fig. 15.5e): for very thick material, allows welding from both sides. 15.3.5 welding technique (figure 15.6) direction of heat concentration. forehand welding (fig. 15.6b): torch points in direction of welding. heat not concentrated as much into metal ahead. used for relatively thin parts. backhand welding (fig. 15.6c): torch points opposite to direction of welding. heat concentrated into metal ahead. for thicker parts. 15.4 arc welding widely accepted: best, most economical, practical method. principle: requires electrode, low voltage-high current power source, cables, workpiece. workpiece connected to one cable, electrode to other. electric arc struck between workpiece and electrode. large current jumps, producing immense heat. electrode moved along seam to melt and fuse metal. 15.4.1 electron theory of arc column (figure 15.7) electric arc struck: electrons flow from cathode (electrode) to anode (workpiece). electrons (small mass, high velocity) convert kinetic energy to heat upon striking workpiece. positively charged ions (anode to cathode) provide protective shield for electrons. ~50% electrical energy becomes heat. ~2/3 of released heat is at anode (positive pole) in dc systems. ac: heat equalized. 15.4.2 arc welding process (figure 15.8) heat from electrical energy. electrodes: thin metal/graphite rods. arc initiated by striking electrode tip against workpiece, then quickly withdrawing to maintain arc. arc temp ~30,000°c, melts base metal and electrode tip. electrode metal mixes with molten base metal. electrode consumed, moved down at uniform speed along weld line. coated electrodes (fig. 15.8b): coating acts as flux. forms gaseous shield around weld, protects molten metal from atmosphere (oxygen). flux melts, mixes with impurities in molten pool, floats to top. forms slag on cooling, protects hot weld bead from further contamination. 15.4.3 weld penetration (figure 15.9) depth to which base metal is affected. mechanical strength depends on penetration depth. dc current: straight polarity (workpiece positive) (fig. 15.9a): more heat at work, more penetration. for thicker workpieces. reverse polarity (workpiece negative) (fig. 15.9b): ~2/3 heat at electrode tip, less penetration. for thinner workpieces. ac current (fig. 15.9c): combines characteristics of both. operating conditions: current, voltage, welding speed. too low current: poor penetration. too high: excessive spatter, irregular deposits. too high speed: less metal deposition, small beads, weak joints. too slow: overlapping beads, no more penetration. 15.5 gas welding (figure 15.10) fusion welding: heat from combustion of oxygen + fuel gas (acetylene, propane, butane, natural gas). gases burned with oxygen (not air, as n₂ lowers flame temp). oxy-acetylene welding: most common. oxygen supports combustion, acetylene is fuel. highest flame temp (~3300°c). oxy-hydrogen ~2200°c. fuel gases are hydrocarbons (c, h). burned with pure o₂, produce co₂ + h₂o (can damage reactive metals like ti). metals welded should not be reactive to combustion products. commonly used for repairs. 15.5.1 gas welding process (fig. 15.10a - setup, fig. 15.10b - combustion triangle) equipment: oxygen cylinder, acetylene cylinder, hoses, regulators (reduce cylinder pressure to working line pressure), torch. operation: gases mixed in torch mixing chamber, ejected through nozzle/tip, ignited by spark. (kindling temp reached for combustion - fig 15.10b). flame type/temp controlled by o₂/acetylene ratio via torch valves. sound weld depends on: torch size, flame, filler material, torch movement. joint heated till weld pool forms, filler metal added as rod/wire. combustion reaction (oxy-acetylene): $$ \\color{white} 2\\text{c}_2\\text{h}_2 + 5\\text{o}_2 \\rightarrow 4\\text{co}_2 + 2\\text{h}_2\\text{o} \\text{ (vapour) } + \\text{heat} (\\approx 300 \\text{ kcal/mole}) $$ temperature generated: ~3300°c. 15.5.2 types of flames carbonizing flame (reducing flame): excess acetylene. low flame temp. unburnt carbon forced into molten metal, makes ferrous weld bead hard/brittle. oxidizing flame: excess oxygen. hottest flame. causes metal to burn/oxidize quickly. neutral flame (balanced flame): equal o₂/acetylene. little effect on base metal. produces sound weld beads compared to others. 15.5.3 fluxes during fusion, o₂ (atmosphere/torch) forms oxides with molten metal. oxides entrapped → low quality/strength welds. flux removes oxides from parent metal surfaces, helps oxides float in molten pool. reacts with oxides to form slag (low melting point, low density). slag floats, protects weld from oxidation during solidification/cooling. common fluxes: sodium, potassium, lithium, borax. applied as paste, powder, liquid, solid coating, or gas. 15.5.4 filler material generally added. melted by flame, fills space between pieces. must be same composition as base metal. some metals welded without extra filler: autogenous welding. 15.6 resistance welding (figure 15.11, 15.12) also known as electric welding. heat from electrical resistance between two members to be joined. $$ \\color{white} h = i^2 r t k \\quad (\\text{eq } 15.1) $$ `h`: heat (joules), `i`: current (amps), `r`: resistance (ohms), `t`: time (secs), `k`: constant for losses (<1). five basic methods: spot, seam, projection, flash, upset welding. (focus on first two). 15.6.1 spot welding (figure 15.11) simplest, commonest. for sheets. two solid cylindrical electrode tips placed on lap joint of two sheets. high current passed. heat at contact point melts metals locally. current off, melt solidifies → small circular weld (nugget). strength depends on surface roughness/cleanliness. surfaces must be cleaned. 15.6.2 seam welding (figure 15.12) cylindrical spot welding electrodes replaced by electrode wheels (rollers). metals drawn between rollers. continuous ac supply. electrically conducting wheels produce continuous weld (series of overlapping spot welds) when current is high in ac cycle. (fig. 15.12b shows continuous spot welds). 15.6.3 tungsten inert gas (tig) welding (gas tungsten arc welding - gtaw) (figure 15.13) arc welding process with non-consumable tungsten electrode in protective inert gas atmosphere. process: tungsten electrode in holder strikes arc with base metal. electrode shielded by inert gas (argon, co₂, helium). arc melts base metal, filler supplied from rod to puddle. backside of joint also protected (carbon block bars or shielding gas). for al, mg (oxidize/burn easily), stainless steel, monel, tungsten, bronze. can weld dissimilar metals. does not produce deep penetration; needs more passes for thick metals. slow, expensive. 15.7 soldering and brazing metal parts heated (not melted), molten filler flows between closely placed adjacent surfaces by capillary action. strong joint forms on cooling by bond between parent metal and filler metal atoms. suitable for dissimilar metals. distinction: soldering: filler metal melts below 450°c. brazing: filler metal melts above 450°c (up to 900°c, but below base metal melting point). 15.7.1 soldering (figure 15.14) for low mechanical strength joints. filler = solder (low melting point). mostly pb-sn alloys. may contain cd, sb. composition determines properties. forms: bar, stick, fill, wire, strip, rings. cored solder wire: tube of solder filled with flux. wetting: metallic surface must be capable of being wetted by solder. liquid solubility needed. atoms of solder may form solid solution or intermetallic compound with base metal. cleanliness: wetting affected by surface cleanliness. thin oxide film inhibits wetting. flux used to dissolve oxide film and protect surface until wetted. basic operations: shaping and fitting parts: close fit for capillary action. large gap → no capillary action, weak joint. cleaning surfaces: remove dirt, grease for strong atomic bonds. flux application: essential. clean metal rapidly oxidizes with heat. flux breaks/removes oxide film. common fluxes: sodium, potassium, lithium, borax. applied as paste, powder, liquid, solid coating, or gas. application of heat and solder: parts held (vice/fixture). heat parts to solder-melting/alloying temp before applying solder. heat via soldering iron (heated electrically/other). soldering iron's sole function is to heat the joint. (fig 15.14): soldering simple lap joint. heat applied → flux breaks oxide film → solder applied, melts → metal-to-metal contact via molten solder → cool. other heating: blowtorches, dipping in molten solder. 15.7.2 brazing aws definition: coalescence by heating >500°c, using non-ferrous filler metal (melts <900°c, below base metal mp), distributed by capillary action. for thicker parts or stronger joints. similar/dissimilar parts. like soldering: success depends on molten filler (low surface tension) flowing easily over properly heated, clean base metal. base metal not melted. some diffusion/alloying of filler with base metal occurs. surfaces must be chemically clean. fluxes (e.g., borax) remove oxides. borax dissolves most common metal oxides. methods (based on heating): torch brazing: most widely used. heat from oxy-acetylene gas flame (carbonizing flame suitable). furnace brazing: for large number of small/medium parts. filler (granular, powder, strips) placed at joint, assembly heated in furnace. 15.8 mechanical fasteners (figure 15.15 - 15.22) devices to hold two parts together. easily unfastened, parts separated without damage. mostly for temporary/semi-permanent joints. welding gives permanent. applications: where dismantling needed (replacement/maintenance). materials not weldable/brazable/solderable (e.g., wood). no heat/filler needed. huge variety. boeing 747 uses ~2.5 million fasteners. selection factors: service type, materials joined, joint type, required strength. categories: threaded fasteners: threads cut on them (entire or part length). (nuts, bolts, screws). non-threaded fasteners: no threads. (rivets). 15.8.1 threaded fasteners (fig 15.15 - methodology) internal threads = nuts. external threads = bolts/screws. threads may be cut in holes in parts. joining by frictional surface contact between internal/external threads. relative motion → axial motion, tightening parts. screw fasteners (fig 15.16): single piece, external threads. one part usually has internal threads. machine screws (fig 15.16): for assembly where one part has tapped hole. various heads (countersunk, raised countersunk, round, hexagon) and tails (flat, conical, spherical). screwdriver for slot, spanner for hex. (fig 15.16e - grub screw). socket screws (fig 15.17): hexagonal socket in head. tightened with l-shaped allen key. higher strength joints than machine screws. (cap head, countersunk head shown). self-tapping screws: for fast assembly. no pre-drilled/tapped holes needed. hardened, produce own thread in pilot hole. good vibration resistance. tapping op not needed. bolts and nuts (fig 15.18 - bolts, fig 15.19 - nuts): two-part. bolt: headed cylindrical bar, threaded shank. used with nuts for stronger joints. bolts usually partly threaded (twice bolt diameter). (fig 15.18): hexagonal head, square head bolts. (fig 15.19): hexagonal nut (common), wing nut (hand tightening). studs (fig 15.20): headless bolt, threaded both ends. for joining parts where both have threaded holes. (e.g., engine cylinder head to block). locking devices: prevent loosening from vibration/stress (lock pins, lock nuts, locking washers, headed keys). 15.8.2 non-threaded fasteners (figure 15.21, 15.22) rivets (fig. 15.21): cylindrical bar, pre-formed head one end. other end deformed after fitting. for semi-permanent joints (need not be normally dismantled). can be permanent if parts never dismantled. unfastening by chipping off head (can damage parts). parts (fig. 15.21): head, body/shank, tail. used in structural/machine work (vibration), poor weldability metals. (boiler drums, roof trusses, bridges, towers). for shear stresses, not tension. riveting process (fig. 15.22): drill holes in parts (fig 15.22a). align holes, insert rivet (fig 15.22b). deform tail end to form second head (fig 15.22c) (manual hammer or riveting machine). finished joint (fig 15.22d). unfastening: cut one head, blow rivet out.",

    "textContent": "additive manufacturing: overview core concept: additive manufacturing (am), also commonly known as 3d printing, refers to a collection of processes used to create three-dimensional objects by adding material layer by layer, directly from a digital model (typically a cad file). this is fundamentally different from subtractive manufacturing (where material is removed, like in machining) or formative manufacturing (where material is reshaped, like in casting or forging). example application: the image of a \"titanium acetabular cup\" (a component of an artificial hip joint) showcases a key application area, particularly for custom medical devices made from advanced materials. advantages of additive manufacturing custom built: enables the production of highly personalized and unique items. since each part is built directly from a digital file without the need for part-specific tooling, complex customizations are feasible. this is critical for applications like patient-specific medical implants or bespoke tools. less material wastage: am processes generally use only the material required to form the part and any necessary support structures. this contrasts sharply with subtractive methods that can generate significant scrap material, leading to better material utilization, especially for expensive materials like titanium or specialized polymers. complex parts: facilitates the creation of intricate geometries, internal features (like cooling channels or lattice structures for lightweighting), and consolidated assemblies (printing multiple components as a single part) that would be difficult, costly, or impossible to produce using traditional manufacturing techniques. key application examples: bioimplants: custom-fit medical devices (hips, knees, dental implants, cranial plates) often designed with porous structures to promote better integration with biological tissues. aeroengines: manufacturing of lightweight, complex components (e.g., fuel nozzles, turbine blades with sophisticated internal cooling) designed for enhanced performance and fuel efficiency. an image of an additively manufactured aeroengine component is shown later in the slides. limitations of additive manufacturing costly: equipment: the initial investment for am machines, particularly those for metal or high-performance polymers, can be substantial. materials: raw materials for am (e.g., specialized metal powders, photopolymer resins, high-grade filaments) are often more expensive than their conventional counterparts. build time & labor: layer-by-layer construction can be a slow process, especially for large or highly detailed parts, contributing to higher per-part costs. post-processing steps can also add to labor costs. not meant for mass production: while am technologies are continually advancing, they are generally less economical for very high-volume production runs where traditional methods like injection molding or casting benefit from economies of scale. am is typically more competitive for prototyping, low-to-medium volume production, or parts requiring high degrees of customization. residual stress related issues: many am processes, especially those involving localized melting and solidification of material (like metal powder bed fusion or directed energy deposition), create significant thermal gradients and rapid heating/cooling cycles. these thermal cycles can lead to the build-up of internal residual stresses within the printed part. consequences of residual stress can include: warping or distortion of the part (during or after printing), cracking, reduced fatigue life, and deviations from desired mechanical properties. post-processing steps, such as heat treatment (stress relieving), are often necessary to mitigate these issues, adding to the overall production time and cost. fused deposition modelling (fdm) core concept: fdm is a widely used and often more accessible additive manufacturing technique. it operates by extruding a molten thermoplastic filament through a nozzle, depositing it layer by layer to construct a 3d object. process: a thermoplastic filament (wire-like plastic) is unwound from a spool and fed into a heated extruder head (nozzle). the filament melts within the heated nozzle. the extruder head, controlled by a computer, moves in precise x-y coordinates across a build platform, depositing the molten material. the deposited material cools, solidifies, and fuses to the layer below it. once a layer is completed, the build platform moves down (or the extruder head moves up) by a small increment (the layer thickness), and the process is repeated for the next layer until the object is fully formed. starting material: thermoplastic (e.g., abs, pla) thermoplastics: a class of polymers that become soft and moldable when heated to a specific temperature and then solidify upon cooling. they can typically be remelted and reshaped multiple times without significant degradation of their properties. abs (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene): a common engineering thermoplastic known for its good strength, toughness, and impact resistance. it generally requires a heated build platform to prevent warping during printing. pla (polylactic acid): a biodegradable thermoplastic derived from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane. it is easier to print with than abs (often doesn't require a heated bed), has less odor during printing, and produces parts with a slightly more glossy finish. it is generally less strong and durable than abs. stereolithography (sla) core concept: sla is one of the earliest forms of additive manufacturing. it creates objects by selectively curing a liquid photosensitive resin, layer by layer, using a focused ultraviolet (uv) laser beam. process: a build platform is submerged just below the surface of a vat of liquid photopolymer resin. a uv laser, directed by mirrors (galvanometers), traces the cross-section of the first layer onto the surface of the resin. the uv light causes the exposed resin to solidify (cure or polymerize). after the layer is cured, the platform is lowered by one layer thickness into the vat. a recoater blade may sweep across the surface to ensure a fresh, even layer of liquid resin for the next exposure. the laser then traces and cures the next layer, which adheres to the previously cured layer. this process repeats until the entire object is built. after printing, the part is typically removed from the vat, cleaned of excess uncured resin (often with a solvent like isopropyl alcohol), and then undergoes a final post-curing step in a uv oven to ensure full solidification and achieve optimal mechanical properties. starting material: photosensitive resin photosensitive resins (photopolymers): liquid polymers that undergo a chemical reaction (polymerization or cross-linking) and solidify when exposed to light of a specific wavelength, typically uv light. different resin formulations offer varying mechanical properties, colors, and transparencies. source: laser source a uv laser is used to provide the energy needed to cure the resin with high precision. the laser beam is precisely controlled to draw the shape of each layer. (the provided youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw4ebcwajhe would offer a visual demonstration of the sla process.) selective laser sintering (sls) & selective laser melting (slm) starting material (for both): powder both sls and slm use powdered materials as their feedstock. this can include polymers (like nylon for sls), metals (like titanium, aluminum, stainless steel, tool steel for slm and sometimes sls), or ceramics. source (for both): laser in both the cases a high-power laser is used to selectively fuse the powder particles together, layer by layer, according to the digital model. sls – selective laser sintering fusion occurs by sintering or atomic mobility – no full melting. in sls, the laser heats the powder particles to a point where their surfaces fuse together (sinter) without the material reaching its full melting point. this process relies on atomic diffusion at the particle boundaries to create a solid mass. because the powder is not fully melted, sls parts can sometimes be slightly porous compared to slm parts, though advancements are improving density. a key advantage of sls (especially with polymers) is that the un-sintered powder in the build chamber acts as a natural support structure for the part being built, often eliminating the need for dedicated support structures that must be removed later. commonly used for functional prototypes and end-use parts from polymers like nylon. metal sls is also possible but less common than slm for metals due to potential porosity. slm – selective laser melting fusion occurs by melting – more dense products. in slm, the laser provides enough energy to fully melt the powder particles in the targeted area. the molten material then cools and solidifies, fusing with the previous layer. this full melting and resolidification process typically results in parts with very high density (often >99%), comparable to conventionally manufactured metal parts. slm is predominantly used for producing metal components with good mechanical properties. due to the full melting, support structures are usually required for overhanging features and to anchor the part to the build plate, managing thermal stresses. these supports must be removed in post-processing. additive manufactured aeroengine component image: shows a complex aeroengine component, likely a fan or compressor section, illustrating the capability of additive manufacturing to produce intricate, high-value parts for demanding applications like aerospace. relevance: as mentioned in the advantages of am, aeroengine components are a prime example where the benefits of complex geometries, lightweighting (through optimized designs or internal lattice structures), and part consolidation (reducing the number of individual components in an assembly) can be realized through processes like slm. this can lead to improved engine performance, reduced weight, and potentially lower manufacturing lead times for certain components.",
